# Circleback vs. Read.ai – Which should you choose?  
AI meeting notes platforms provide four primary deliverables:  
  
* Transcripts create a word-for-word record of the meeting. For example, a one-hour product development meeting generates a searchable document containing every feature discussion, technical requirement, and team decision.  
* Action items are pulled directly from the conversation. When someone says "John will update the wireframes by Friday," the AI automatically creates a tracked task with the assignee and deadline.  
* Meeting summaries distill hour-long conversations into 2-3 paragraphs. A 45-minute sprint planning meeting becomes a concise overview of sprint goals, resource allocation, and key decisions.  
* Topic segmentation breaks discussions into labeled sections. A client call covering multiple projects is automatically divided into sections like "Website Redesign," "Q1 Marketing Campaign," and "Budget Review."  
  
In addition to the quality of these deliverables, we'll want to look at a number of other key factors:  
  
* Free trial: can you test it for free before committing?  
* Ease-of-use: does it have a simple, intuitive setup that works for non-technical users?  
* In-person meeting support: can it transcribe audio from live recordings or uploaded files, not just virtual calls?  
* Security and privacy: how is customer data handled on the platform?  
* Integrations: can it connect with your existing stack, like HubSpot, Notion, or Slack?  
* Functionality: does it go beyond transcriptions and actually help you take action?  
* Languages: can it transcribe and summarize meetings in different languages?  
* Desktop and mobile apps: can you access it on Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android for on-the-go meetings?  
* Recordings: is there support for saving and playing back audio and video recordings of meetings?    
## Evaluating Circleback and Read.ai  
### Circleback
* Circleback provides automated meeting notes within minutes and integrates with calendars, Slack, and CRM systems. The tool focuses on core meeting transcription and summary features without video recording capabilities.

### Read.ai
* Read.ai offers meeting transcription, engagement analytics, speaker metrics, and supports 16+ languages with real-time translation. The tool has a 5-meeting monthly limit on the free tier, requires some learning due to its interface complexity, and some users have raised privacy concerns about unauthorized meeting monitoring.  
## Comparison table    
Small teams and startups that need basic meeting tools but want local recording and desktop apps would find Circleback useful, though they may wish it connected to more of their daily tools. The automation features and cross-platform support make it a reasonable choice for teams that want to capture meetings without much complexity.

Larger companies already using cloud solutions and wanting mobile-first tools would likely prefer Read.ai's approach, even if it lacks some practical features for getting work done after meetings end. The cloud-native design and enterprise security make it suitable for distributed teams, though users may need additional tools to fully action their meeting outcomes.
