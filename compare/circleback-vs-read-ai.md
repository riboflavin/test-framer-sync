# Circleback vs. Read.ai – Which should you choose?  
AI meeting notes platforms provide four primary deliverables:  
  
* Transcripts create a word-for-word record of the meeting. For example, a one-hour product development meeting generates a searchable document containing every feature discussion, technical requirement, and team decision.  
* Action items are pulled directly from the conversation. When someone says "John will update the wireframes by Friday," the AI automatically creates a tracked task with the assignee and deadline.  
* Meeting summaries distill hour-long conversations into 2-3 paragraphs. A 45-minute sprint planning meeting becomes a concise overview of sprint goals, resource allocation, and key decisions.  
* Topic segmentation breaks discussions into labeled sections. A client call covering multiple projects is automatically divided into sections like "Website Redesign," "Q1 Marketing Campaign," and "Budget Review."  
  
In addition to the quality of these deliverables, we'll want to look at a number of other key factors:  
  
* Free trial: can you test it for free before committing?  
* Ease-of-use: does it have a simple, intuitive setup that works for non-technical users?  
* In-person meeting support: can it transcribe audio from live recordings or uploaded files, not just virtual calls?  
* Security and privacy: how is customer data handled on the platform?  
* Integrations: can it connect with your existing stack, like HubSpot, Notion, or Slack?  
* Functionality: does it go beyond transcriptions and actually help you take action?  
* Languages: can it transcribe and summarize meetings in different languages?  
* Desktop and mobile apps: can you access it on Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android for on-the-go meetings?  
* Recordings: is there support for saving and playing back audio and video recordings of meetings?    
## Evaluating Circleback and Read.ai  
### Circleback
* Circleback provides automated meeting notes within minutes and integrates with calendars, Slack, and CRM systems. The tool focuses on core meeting transcription and summary features without video recording capabilities.

### Read.ai
* Read.ai offers meeting transcription, engagement analytics, speaker metrics, and supports 16+ languages with real-time translation. The tool has a 5-meeting monthly limit on the free tier, requires some learning due to its interface complexity, and some users have raised privacy concerns about unauthorized meeting monitoring.  
## Comparison table    
Circleback makes sense for companies that need local recording and desktop software, particularly those with strict security requirements or unreliable internet connections. The automation features could help teams who have repetitive meeting workflows, though the actual integrations are fairly basic and won't dramatically change how work gets done.

Read.ai is a simpler choice for teams that just want cloud-based meeting tools and don't need complex features or desktop apps. While it handles the basics well and offers similar integrations to Circleback, it lacks deeper workflow capabilities that could make meetings more productive and actionable.
