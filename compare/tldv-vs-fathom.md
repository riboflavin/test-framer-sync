## Comparing tldv and Fathom

### tldv

* tldv offers AI meeting recording, transcription, and summarization with a focus on CRM integration. While providing accurate transcriptions and a generous free plan, it suffers from limited platform support and requires stable internet connection.

* The tool integrates with various platforms including HubSpot, Notion, and Salesforce, though its integration ecosystem lacks depth for meaningful workflow automation. Despite having AI agents for recording and note-taking, tldv still requires significant user involvement to extract actionable value from meetings.

### Fathom

* Fathom functions primarily as an AI meeting notetaker for Zoom, Google Meet, and Teams with real-time transcription and various AI summary formats. While offering an intuitive interface and quick summaries, it lacks support for external audio uploads and doesn't have a mobile app.

* Though Fathom connects with major CRMs and can push meeting content to other tools, its integration capabilities remain superficial rather than transformative. The tool automates basic meeting capture tasks but falls short in helping users meaningfully act upon the information gathered.

tldv is better suited for teams heavily invested in CRM workflows who need to capture and reference meeting content across multiple platforms. Its broader claimed integration ecosystem and slightly more comprehensive feature set make it appropriate for organizations with complex document management needs, though users should be prepared to spend more for business-level functionality.

Fathom works best for individual professionals or small teams focused primarily on virtual meetings who need quick, accurate meeting summaries and action items. Its more affordable pricing structure and straightforward approach to AI note-taking make it accessible for freelancers and small businesses, though both tools ultimately require users to develop their own systems for turning meeting content into meaningful action.

## tldv vs Fathom: What do users say?

Users of tldv commonly praise its accurate transcriptions, intuitive user interface, and generous free plan. However, some note limitations in platform support, dependence on internet quality, and occasional privacy concerns. The tool offers AI meeting recording, transcription, summarization, and integrates with many platforms including HubSpot, Notion, and Salesforce. Meanwhile, Fathom users highlight its outstanding free tier that offers more generous features than competitors, with quick and accurate transcriptions and AI-generated summaries appearing seconds after meetings.
