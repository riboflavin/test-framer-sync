# tldv vs Zoom AI for meeting automation

Tldv is a meeting tool that records, transcribes, and summarizes conversations across multiple platforms. It creates timestamps and highlights, integrates with CRMs, and deploys AI agents to handle recording and note-taking tasks. The system works with over 30 languages and connects to thousands of other applications including HubSpot, Notion, and Salesforce.

The service offers tiered pricing with free, Pro ($18/month), and Business ($59/month) options. It provides desktop applications for Windows and macOS that enable local recording for Zoom and Microsoft Teams meetings. While tldv doesn't have a native mobile app and cannot record in-person meetings, it does offer local recording capabilities through its desktop software. Some users have noted limitations in platform support and potential issues with internet-dependent performance.

Zoom AI is a built-in feature for paid Zoom users that generates meeting summaries and action items automatically at the end of calls. It lets participants ask questions during meetings (like "What did I miss?"), helps compose emails and chats, and works within the existing Zoom interface without requiring additional setup or applications. The system produces almost instant meeting recaps and supports transcription in over 30 languages across desktop and mobile platforms.

The tool has significant limitations - it only works within Zoom meetings and isn't available on the free plan beyond trial uses. Its meeting management capabilities are less robust than dedicated transcription tools, with users noting basic chat integration and occasional difficulties sharing AI notes outside the Zoom environment. While it offers local meeting recording, AI summaries require Zoom's cloud service, and it lacks substantial integrations with external platforms like HubSpot or Notion.

## Comparing tldv and Zoom AI

### tldv
* Tldv offers meeting recording, transcription, summarization, and integrates with CRMs, while relying on AI agents for key functions. Despite having accurate transcriptions and an intuitive interface, the platform suffers from limited support across meeting platforms and depends heavily on internet connection quality.
* The tool provides local recording capabilities for Zoom and Teams through its desktop app, along with extensive third-party integrations. However, tldv falls short on meaningful workflow integration depth and lacks the robust automation needed to transform meeting insights into actionable outcomes.

### Zoom AI
* Zoom AI provides built-in meeting summaries, live question answering, and document creation capabilities directly within the Zoom platform. While offering seamless integration for existing Zoom users, the tool is limited exclusively to Zoom meetings and offers basic functionality compared to specialized meeting tools.
* The service is included with paid Zoom subscriptions but unavailable to free users, and its integration capabilities remain confined to Zoom's ecosystem. Zoom AI's limited cross-platform support and shallow integration depth restrict its ability to meaningfully connect meeting insights to users' broader workflows.

| Feature | tldv | Zoom AI |
|---------|------|---------|
| Pricing | Free-$59/mo | Included w/Zoom |
| Platform Support | Multiple platforms | Zoom only ❌ |
| Local Recording | Yes ✅ | Partial ❌ |
| Integrations | Extensive ✅ | Limited ❌ |
| Automation | Basic agents | Limited features ❌ |
| Mobile App | No ❌ | Yes ✅ |
| Language Support | 30+ languages ✅ | 36 languages ✅ |
| Integration Depth | Surface level ❌ | Surface level ❌ |
| Actionable Insights | Limited ❌ | Limited ❌ |

Tldv is better suited for teams that use multiple meeting platforms and need a centralized solution for recording and transcribing across different tools. Organizations that value integration with CRMs and other workflow tools will appreciate tldv's broader connectivity, though they may find its automation capabilities still require significant manual intervention to translate meeting insights into actual work.

Zoom AI is the logical choice for organizations already standardized on Zoom that want a zero-setup solution with no additional cost. Teams that prioritize simplicity and mobile access will prefer Zoom's integrated approach, though they'll need to accept its platform limitations and lack of deep integration with external tools. Neither option fully solves the problem of translating meeting content into meaningful workflow actions.

## tldv vs Zoom AI: What do users say?

User reviews of tldv highlight its strengths in accurate transcriptions, intuitive user interface, and generous free plan options. Users appreciate the AI meeting recording, transcription, and summarization capabilities, along with CRM integration features. However, some concerns exist regarding limited platform support, dependence on internet quality, and privacy issues. Meanwhile, Zoom AI Companion receives praise for its seamless integration with the Zoom platform, requiring no additional setup for existing Zoom users. Users value the instant meeting summaries, highlighted action items, and the fact that it's included at no extra cost for paid Zoom accounts. On the downside, Zoom AI only works within the Zoom ecosystem, offers limited integration options outside Zoom, and some users find certain features less developed compared to dedicated tools.
