# tldv vs Zoom AI – Feature and product comparison

AI meeting notes platforms provide four primary deliverables:
* Transcripts that create a word-for-word record of the meeting. For example, a one-hour product development meeting generates a searchable document containing every feature discussion, technical requirement, and team decision.
* Action items are pulled directly from the conversation. When someone says "John will update the wireframes by Friday," the AI automatically creates a tracked task with the assignee and deadline.
* Meeting summaries distill hour-long conversations into 2-3 paragraphs. A 45-minute sprint planning meeting becomes a concise overview of sprint goals, resource allocation, and key decisions.
* Topic segmentation breaks discussions into labeled sections. A client call covering multiple projects is automatically divided into sections like "Website Redesign," "Q1 Marketing Campaign," and "Budget Review."

In addition to the quality of these deliverables, we'll want to look at a number of other key factors:
* Ease-of-use: does it have a simple, intuitive setup that works for non-technical users?
* In-person meeting support: can it transcribe audio from live recordings or uploaded files, not just virtual calls?
* Security and privacy: how is customer data handled on the platform?
* Integrations: can it connect with your existing stack, like HubSpot, Notion, or Slack?
* Functionality: does it go beyond transcriptions and actually help you take action?
* Languages: can it transcribe and summarize meetings in different languages?
* Desktop and mobile apps: can you access it on Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android for on-the-go meetings?

## About tldv
Tldv is a meeting tool that records, transcribes, and summarizes conversations across multiple platforms. It creates timestamps and highlights, integrates with CRMs, and deploys AI agents to handle recording and note-taking tasks. The system works with over 30 languages and connects to thousands of other applications including HubSpot, Notion, and Salesforce.

The service offers tiered pricing with free, Pro ($18/month), and Business ($59/month) options. It provides desktop applications for Windows and macOS that enable local recording for Zoom and Microsoft Teams meetings. While tldv doesn't have a native mobile app and cannot record in-person meetings, it does offer local recording capabilities through its desktop software. Some users have noted limitations in platform support and potential issues with internet-dependent performance.

## About Zoom AI
Zoom AI is a built-in feature for paid Zoom users that generates meeting summaries and action items automatically at the end of calls. It lets participants ask questions during meetings (like "What did I miss?"), helps compose emails and chats, and works within the existing Zoom interface without requiring additional setup or applications. The system produces almost instant meeting recaps and supports transcription in over 30 languages across desktop and mobile platforms.

The tool has significant limitations - it only works within Zoom meetings and isn't available on the free plan beyond trial uses. Its meeting management capabilities are less robust than dedicated transcription tools, with users noting basic chat integration and occasional difficulties sharing AI notes outside the Zoom environment. While it offers local meeting recording, AI summaries require Zoom's cloud service, and it lacks substantial integrations with external platforms like HubSpot or Notion.

## Comparison
### tldv
* Tldv offers meeting recording, transcription, summarization, and integrates with CRMs, while relying on AI agents for key functions. Despite having accurate transcriptions and an intuitive interface, the platform suffers from limited support across meeting platforms and depends heavily on internet connection quality.
* The tool provides local recording capabilities for Zoom and Teams through its desktop app, along with extensive third-party integrations. However, tldv falls short on meaningful workflow integration depth and lacks the robust automation needed to transform meeting insights into actionable outcomes.

### Zoom AI
* Zoom AI provides built-in meeting summaries, live question answering, and document creation capabilities directly within the Zoom platform. While offering seamless integration for existing Zoom users, the tool is limited exclusively to Zoom meetings and offers basic functionality compared to specialized meeting tools.
* The service is included with paid Zoom subscriptions but unavailable to free users, and its integration capabilities remain confined to Zoom's ecosystem. Zoom AI's limited cross-platform support and shallow integration depth restrict its ability to meaningfully connect meeting insights to users' broader workflows.

| Feature | tldv | Zoom AI |
|---------|------|---------|
| Pricing | Free-$59/mo | Included w/Zoom |
| Platform Support | Multiple platforms | Zoom only ❌ |
| Local Recording | Yes ✅ | Partial ❌ |
| Integrations | Extensive ✅ | Limited ❌ |
| Automation | Basic agents | Limited features ❌ |
| Mobile App | No ❌ | Yes ✅ |
| Language Support | 30+ languages ✅ | 36 languages ✅ |
| Integration Depth | Surface level ❌ | Surface level ❌ |
| Actionable Insights | Limited ❌ | Limited ❌ |

Tldv is better suited for teams that use multiple meeting platforms and need a centralized solution for recording and transcribing across different tools. Organizations that value integration with CRMs and other workflow tools will appreciate tldv's broader connectivity, though they may find its automation capabilities still require significant manual intervention to translate meeting insights into actual work.

Zoom AI is the logical choice for organizations already standardized on Zoom that want a zero-setup solution with no additional cost. Teams that prioritize simplicity and mobile access will prefer Zoom's integrated approach, though they'll need to accept its platform limitations and lack of deep integration with external tools. Neither option fully solves the problem of translating meeting content into meaningful workflow actions.
