# Fathom vs. Zoom AI – Which should you choose?  
AI meeting notes platforms provide four primary deliverables:  
  
* Transcripts create a word-for-word record of the meeting. For example, a one-hour product development meeting generates a searchable document containing every feature discussion, technical requirement, and team decision.  
* Action items are pulled directly from the conversation. When someone says "John will update the wireframes by Friday," the AI automatically creates a tracked task with the assignee and deadline.  
* Meeting summaries distill hour-long conversations into 2-3 paragraphs. A 45-minute sprint planning meeting becomes a concise overview of sprint goals, resource allocation, and key decisions.  
* Topic segmentation breaks discussions into labeled sections. A client call covering multiple projects is automatically divided into sections like "Website Redesign," "Q1 Marketing Campaign," and "Budget Review."  
  
In addition to the quality of these deliverables, we'll want to look at a number of other key factors:  
  
* Free trial: can you test it for free before committing?  
* Ease-of-use: does it have a simple, intuitive setup that works for non-technical users?  
* In-person meeting support: can it transcribe audio from live recordings or uploaded files, not just virtual calls?  
* Security and privacy: how is customer data handled on the platform?  
* Integrations: can it connect with your existing stack, like HubSpot, Notion, or Slack?  
* Functionality: does it go beyond transcriptions and actually help you take action?  
* Languages: can it transcribe and summarize meetings in different languages?  
* Desktop and mobile apps: can you access it on Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android for on-the-go meetings?  
* Recordings: is there support for saving and playing back audio and video recordings of meetings?    
## Evaluating Fathom and Zoom AI  
### Fathom
* Fathom offers a generous free plan with quick transcription and instant AI summaries, multiple summary formats, and a simple interface for live meetings. The tool lacks external audio file support, has no mobile app, requires desktop use, and gates some features like meeting templates behind paid plans.

### Zoom AI
* Zoom AI integrates directly into Zoom meetings with automatic content tracking and instant summaries, requiring no additional setup and included with paid Zoom accounts. The tool only works within Zoom, has basic chat integration, limited meeting management controls, and free users face the standard 40-minute meeting limit.  
## Comparison table    
Small teams and startups that need flexible meeting tools and want to experiment with AI features would likely prefer Fathom, since it offers a trial and has more automation options despite its limited integration depth. The lack of mobile apps and in-person support makes it best for remote-first companies who primarily work from computers.

Large enterprises already using Zoom might naturally gravitate toward Zoom AI, though they'll need to work around its basic automation capabilities and integration constraints. Its mobile support makes it more suitable for hybrid teams, but like Fathom, it doesn't solve the core challenge of making meetings more productive or actionable.
