# Fathom vs. Zoom AI: Which should you choose?
AI meeting notes platforms provide four primary deliverables:

• Transcripts create a word-for-word record of the meeting. For example, a one-hour product development meeting generates a searchable document containing every feature discussion, technical requirement, and team decision.
• Action items are pulled directly from the conversation. When someone says "John will update the wireframes by Friday," the AI automatically creates a tracked task with the assignee and deadline.
• Meeting summaries distill hour-long conversations into 2-3 paragraphs. A 45-minute sprint planning meeting becomes a concise overview of sprint goals, resource allocation, and key decisions.
• Topic segmentation breaks discussions into labeled sections. A client call covering multiple projects is automatically divided into sections like "Website Redesign," "Q1 Marketing Campaign," and "Budget Review."

In addition to the quality of these deliverables, we'll want to look at a number of other key factors:

• Free trial: can you test it for free before committing?
• Ease-of-use: does it have a simple, intuitive setup that works for non-technical users?
• In-person meeting support: can it transcribe audio from live recordings or uploaded files, not just virtual calls?
• Security and privacy: how is customer data handled on the platform?
• Integrations: can it connect with your existing stack, like HubSpot, Notion, or Slack?
• Functionality: does it go beyond transcriptions and actually help you take action?
• Languages: can it transcribe and summarize meetings in different languages?
• Desktop and mobile apps: can you access it on Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android for on-the-go meeitngs?
• Recordings: is there support for saving and playing back audio and video recordings of meetings?
## Evaluating Fathom and Zoom AI
Fathom offers top-notch accuracy in transcripts and quick, high-quality summaries for free, with support for multiple languages. However, it historically only supported Zoom and lacks live collaboration features, with some duplicate note issues and advanced features requiring a paid plan.

Zoom AI provides native integration with Zoom, real-time Q&A during meetings, and a unique whiteboard AI feature, all included with a paid Zoom subscription. However, it only works with Zoom, requires a paid plan for access, has speaker ID limits, and may transcribe industry jargon poorly due to the lack of custom vocabulary support.
In general, users say that Fathom: - Top-notch accuracy in transcripts, even with multiple speakers​capterra.com
.
- Quick, high-quality summaries that capture key points and decisions​capterra.com
.
- Free unlimited usage for core features (rare in this space)​thebusinessdive.com
.
- Supports many languages (users report better results for non-English than competitors)​capterra.com
.. However, they also say: - Historically Zoom-only (new support for other platforms is recent and in beta)​marketplace.zoom.us
.
- Some duplicate note issues if multiple team members use it simultaneously on a call​capterra.com
.
- Lacks a bit in live collaboration; mainly focused on post-meeting output (notes are viewable after, not edited in real-time by multiple people).
- Advanced features like custom integrations or extended analytics require paid plan (free covers basics)..
In general, users say that Zoom AI: - Native integration – no setup if you use Zoom, and outputs appear right in Zoom Chat​meetjamie.ai
.
- Real-time Q&A and assistance during meetings (ask the AI on the fly).
- Unique whiteboard AI for creating mind-maps/diagrams in meeting​meetjamie.ai
.
- Included with paid Zoom (no extra fee for existing Zoom subscribers)​news.zoom.us
.. However, they also say: - Zoom-only: Doesn’t work on Google Meet, Teams, etc.​meetjamie.ai
.
- No free access – requires a Zoom paid plan (~$15+ monthly)​meetjamie.ai
.
- Speaker ID limits: won’t capture anyone not logged in as Zoom user (e.g., a speaker in the room)​meetjamie.ai
.
- No custom vocabulary, so industry jargon may transcribe poorly​meetjamie.ai

Fathom might appeal to individuals or companies looking for a free and easy-to-use tool with integrations to popular platforms like HubSpot and Notion. However, it lacks depth in integrations and may not fully support users in getting the most out of their meetings. On the other hand, Zoom AI could be attractive to those already using Zoom for meetings, as it offers native integration and mobile apps. Yet, its limited integrations and lack of support for in-person meetings and local recording may hinder its effectiveness in helping users accomplish their meeting goals.
