# Fathom vs. Zoom AI: Which should you choose?  
AI meeting notes platforms provide four primary deliverables:  
  
* Transcripts create a word-for-word record of the meeting. For example, a one-hour product development meeting generates a searchable document containing every feature discussion, technical requirement, and team decision.  
* Action items are pulled directly from the conversation. When someone says "John will update the wireframes by Friday," the AI automatically creates a tracked task with the assignee and deadline.  
* Meeting summaries distill hour-long conversations into 2-3 paragraphs. A 45-minute sprint planning meeting becomes a concise overview of sprint goals, resource allocation, and key decisions.  
* Topic segmentation breaks discussions into labeled sections. A client call covering multiple projects is automatically divided into sections like "Website Redesign," "Q1 Marketing Campaign," and "Budget Review."  
  
In addition to the quality of these deliverables, we'll want to look at a number of other key factors:  
  
* Free trial: can you test it for free before committing?  
* Ease-of-use: does it have a simple, intuitive setup that works for non-technical users?  
* In-person meeting support: can it transcribe audio from live recordings or uploaded files, not just virtual calls?  
* Security and privacy: how is customer data handled on the platform?  
* Integrations: can it connect with your existing stack, like HubSpot, Notion, or Slack?  
* Functionality: does it go beyond transcriptions and actually help you take action?  
* Languages: can it transcribe and summarize meetings in different languages?  
* Desktop and mobile apps: can you access it on Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android for on-the-go meetings?  
* Recordings: is there support for saving and playing back audio and video recordings of meetings?

- Cons: Zoom-only functionality, no free access, speaker ID limits, no custom vocabulary support.  
| Feature                           | Fathom               | Zoom AI              |
|-----------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| Trial/Free Plan                   | ✅ Free unlimited plan| ❌ Requires paid Zoom |
| Zoom & Calendar Integration       | ❌ No                | ✅ Zoom native        |
| Easy to Use?                      | ✅ Very easy         | ✅ Yes               |
| Good for In-Person Meetings?      | ❌ No                | ❌ No                |
| Good for Local Recording?         | ❌ No                | ❌ No                |
| Integrates with HubSpot, Notion, etc.? | ✅ Yes           | ❌ No                |
| Automation Engine?                | ❌ No                | ❌ No                |
| Language Support                  | ✅ Multiple languages| ❌ English only      |
| Desktop App                       | ❌ No (Web-based)    | ❌ No                |
| iPhone & Android Apps             | ✅ Yes (Both)        | ✅ Yes (Zoom app)    |  
- Companies or individuals looking for a free tool with easy usability might opt for Fathom, but may find its lack of integrations limiting. Zoom AI, on the other hand, offers native Zoom integration and a user-friendly interface, but falls short in terms of integrations and practical meeting support.

- Neither tool is ideal for in-person meetings or local recording, and both lack an automation engine. While Fathom supports multiple languages and integrates with platforms like HubSpot and Notion, Zoom AI only supports English and has limited integrations. Ultimately, users may find that both tools have shortcomings in terms of depth of integrations and practical meeting assistance.
