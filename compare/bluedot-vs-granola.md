# Bluedot vs Granola for meeting automation

Bluedot is an AI meeting tool that works as a Chrome extension to record and transcribe meetings across Google Meet, Zoom, and Microsoft Teams without requiring a bot. It transcribes in real-time across 100+ languages, generates meeting notes, and allows one-click syncing to external systems like Salesforce, HubSpot, Notion, and Google Docs. The tool records locally via browser extension, making it usable even when you're not the meeting host.

Pricing starts with a limited free tier (5 meetings lifetime), then ranges from $18/month for Basic (unlimited audio-only recordings up to 1 hour) to $40/month for Business (unlimited video recordings, CRM integrations, topic tracking). Bluedot works primarily through Chrome on desktop with limited mobile support. While it offers broad platform compatibility and integration options, the restrictive free tier and higher pricing at advanced tiers are its main limitations.

Granola is an AI notepad for Mac that captures meeting audio without requiring a bot in the call. It works by listening to system audio from any meeting platform while users jot down brief notes, then automatically produces structured summaries with sections like key takeaways and next steps when the meeting ends. The app offers customizable note templates and an AI assistant to answer questions or generate follow-up content from meeting recordings.

The tool currently works only on Mac with Windows support forthcoming, and offers 25 free meetings before requiring a paid subscription ($18/month for individuals, $14/user/month for business teams). Granola works offline with local recording and transcription, supports about 16 languages, and has limited integrations including calendar sync and Notion export. There's no mobile app yet, and the system requires audio to be played through the user's device to function properly.

## Comparing Bluedot and Granola

### Bluedot

* Bluedot operates as a Chrome extension for meeting recording and transcription, functioning across major platforms like Zoom and Teams without requiring a meeting bot. It offers transcription in over 100 languages and connects to CRMs and project tools, but its integration depth falls short of truly automating post-meeting workflows.
* The free version allows only 5 lifetime meetings, with paid plans ranging from $18-40 per user monthly. While users praise transcription accuracy and the discreet recording capability, Bluedot lacks mobile support and requires Chrome for optimal experience, limiting its usefulness for teams seeking comprehensive meeting management.

### Granola

* Granola is a Mac-only AI notepad that captures meeting audio without bots, allowing users to take minimal notes which it enhances into structured summaries after meetings. It works across all meeting platforms through system audio capture, but offers limited integrations that don't meaningfully connect to users' broader workflows.
* After a 25-meeting free trial, plans start at $18 monthly for individuals. Users appreciate its simple interface and customizable note templates, but Granola's platform limitations (Mac-only with no mobile support) and reliance on device audio capture restrict its utility for diverse team environments.

| Feature | Bluedot | Granola |
|---------|---------|---------|
| In-person meetings | ✅ Bot-free capture | ⚠️ Mac only |
| Local recording | ✅ Desktop app | ✅ Mac only |
| Integrations | ✅ Wide support | ⚠️ Limited options |
| Automation | ✅ Basic workflows | ❌ Notes only |
| Language support | ✅ 100+ languages | ✅ 16 languages |
| Desktop app | ✅ Windows/Mac | ⚠️ Mac only |
| Mobile apps | ❌ Not available | ❌ Not available |

Bluedot suits cross-platform teams needing accurate transcription and basic integration with other tools. The Chrome extension approach makes it accessible to most organizations using standard meeting platforms, though the limited free tier means most users will need to commit to a paid plan quickly.

Granola works best for Mac users who value simplicity and clean note organization. Its strength lies in distilling meetings into structured notes with minimal user input, but the Mac-only limitation and fewer integrations make it less suitable for Windows-based teams or those requiring deep workflow automation.

## Bluedot vs Granola: What do users say?

Bluedot is an AI meeting recorder and note-taker known for its accuracy and discreet operation via a Chrome extension, eliminating the need for meeting bots. Users particularly praise its transcription accuracy, with many claiming it's "the most accurate" AI notetaker they've tried. The tool works across major platforms like Zoom, Google Meet, and Microsoft Teams, and offers seamless integration with CRMs, project tools, and document systems. While Bluedot supports over 100 languages for transcription, users note limitations including a very restricted free tier (only 5 lifetime meetings), Chrome dependency, and relatively steep pricing at higher tiers.

Granola is an AI notepad for meetings that runs on Mac computers and listens to meetings without requiring a bot. Users appreciate its "set and forget" approach, allowing them to focus on conversations while Granola captures and organizes notes afterward. The tool features a clean interface reminiscent of Apple Notes and produces well-structured summaries through customizable templates. Granola works with all meeting platforms by capturing system audio. Main drawbacks include its Mac-only availability (though Windows support is reportedly coming), no mobile app yet, and limitation to desktop access. After a 25-meeting free trial, pricing starts at $18/month for individuals.
