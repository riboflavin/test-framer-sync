# Bluedot vs. Granola – Which should you choose?  
AI meeting notes platforms provide four primary deliverables:  
  
* Transcripts create a word-for-word record of the meeting. For example, a one-hour product development meeting generates a searchable document containing every feature discussion, technical requirement, and team decision.  
* Action items are pulled directly from the conversation. When someone says "John will update the wireframes by Friday," the AI automatically creates a tracked task with the assignee and deadline.  
* Meeting summaries distill hour-long conversations into 2-3 paragraphs. A 45-minute sprint planning meeting becomes a concise overview of sprint goals, resource allocation, and key decisions.  
* Topic segmentation breaks discussions into labeled sections. A client call covering multiple projects is automatically divided into sections like "Website Redesign," "Q1 Marketing Campaign," and "Budget Review."  
  
In addition to the quality of these deliverables, we'll want to look at a number of other key factors:  
  
* Free trial: can you test it for free before committing?  
* Ease-of-use: does it have a simple, intuitive setup that works for non-technical users?  
* In-person meeting support: can it transcribe audio from live recordings or uploaded files, not just virtual calls?  
* Security and privacy: how is customer data handled on the platform?  
* Integrations: can it connect with your existing stack, like HubSpot, Notion, or Slack?  
* Functionality: does it go beyond transcriptions and actually help you take action?  
* Languages: can it transcribe and summarize meetings in different languages?  
* Desktop and mobile apps: can you access it on Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android for on-the-go meetings?  
* Recordings: is there support for saving and playing back audio and video recordings of meetings?    
## Evaluating Bluedot and Granola  
### Bluedot
* Bluedot offers accurate transcription without requiring bot invites, works across major meeting platforms, and integrates with popular apps for automatic note syncing. The tool runs in the background and functions even when not hosting meetings, with broad platform compatibility.
* The free tier is limited to 5 lifetime meetings, requires Chrome for best performance, and lacks mature mobile support. Higher tier plans are needed for advanced features like longer recordings and custom templates, with relatively high pricing for Pro/Business plans.

### Granola
* Granola provides background note-taking with customizable templates and a simple interface similar to Apple Notes. The tool operates discreetly during meetings and produces organized summaries that can be formatted according to user preferences.
* The platform is currently Mac-only with no mobile app, and notes are only accessible via desktop app or web interface. The system requires device audio capture to function, which can limit compatibility with certain meeting room setups.  
## Comparison table    
Bluedot seems aimed at larger companies who need to handle both remote and in-person meetings, with some basic integrations and automation features that could help teams stay organized. The tool offers more features than Granola but still lacks the deep workflow integrations that would make it truly transformative for getting work done.

Granola appears designed for individual users or small teams who primarily need simple, secure meeting recording and transcription capabilities for remote sessions. While it handles the basics well, it shares the same limitations as Bluedot in terms of helping users actually accomplish their meeting goals and drive outcomes.
