# Fireflies.ai vs. Otter.ai – Which should you choose?  
AI meeting notes platforms provide four primary deliverables:  
  
* Transcripts create a word-for-word record of the meeting. For example, a one-hour product development meeting generates a searchable document containing every feature discussion, technical requirement, and team decision.  
* Action items are pulled directly from the conversation. When someone says "John will update the wireframes by Friday," the AI automatically creates a tracked task with the assignee and deadline.  
* Meeting summaries distill hour-long conversations into 2-3 paragraphs. A 45-minute sprint planning meeting becomes a concise overview of sprint goals, resource allocation, and key decisions.  
* Topic segmentation breaks discussions into labeled sections. A client call covering multiple projects is automatically divided into sections like "Website Redesign," "Q1 Marketing Campaign," and "Budget Review."  
  
In addition to the quality of these deliverables, we'll want to look at a number of other key factors:  
  
* Free trial: can you test it for free before committing?  
* Ease-of-use: does it have a simple, intuitive setup that works for non-technical users?  
* In-person meeting support: can it transcribe audio from live recordings or uploaded files, not just virtual calls?  
* Security and privacy: how is customer data handled on the platform?  
* Integrations: can it connect with your existing stack, like HubSpot, Notion, or Slack?  
* Functionality: does it go beyond transcriptions and actually help you take action?  
* Languages: can it transcribe and summarize meetings in different languages?  
* Desktop and mobile apps: can you access it on Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android for on-the-go meetings?  
* Recordings: is there support for saving and playing back audio and video recordings of meetings?    
## Evaluating Fireflies.ai and Otter.ai  
### Fireflies.ai
* Fireflies integrates with major video platforms through a bot, provides post-meeting summaries with action items, and includes features like keyword tracking and sentiment analysis. The service has limited free minutes and storage, shows transcription errors with accents, and sends frequent email notifications that some users find excessive.

### Otter.ai
* Otter offers live transcript editing, generous free transcription limits, and automatic Zoom/calendar recording integration. The service struggles with accent recognition and fast speech, only works in English, and sometimes requires manual correction of speaker identification.  
## Comparison table    
Small teams and startups who need basic meeting transcription but also want to push data into their existing tools would likely choose Fireflies. The automation features and broader integration set make it more suitable for companies trying to connect their meeting content with their existing workflows, even if those integrations aren't particularly deep or actionable.

Individual users and teams who just need simple, reliable transcription primarily in English would find Otter sufficient for their needs. While Otter's more limited feature set and integration options might feel constraining for some users, its straightforward approach works well enough for basic transcription tasks, though like Fireflies it doesn't do much to help users actually accomplish their meeting goals.
