# Fireflies.ai vs. Otter.ai – Which should you choose?  
AI meeting notes platforms provide four primary deliverables:  
  
* Transcripts create a word-for-word record of the meeting. For example, a one-hour product development meeting generates a searchable document containing every feature discussion, technical requirement, and team decision.  
* Action items are pulled directly from the conversation. When someone says "John will update the wireframes by Friday," the AI automatically creates a tracked task with the assignee and deadline.  
* Meeting summaries distill hour-long conversations into 2-3 paragraphs. A 45-minute sprint planning meeting becomes a concise overview of sprint goals, resource allocation, and key decisions.  
* Topic segmentation breaks discussions into labeled sections. A client call covering multiple projects is automatically divided into sections like "Website Redesign," "Q1 Marketing Campaign," and "Budget Review."  
  
In addition to the quality of these deliverables, we'll want to look at a number of other key factors:  
  
* Free trial: can you test it for free before committing?  
* Ease-of-use: does it have a simple, intuitive setup that works for non-technical users?  
* In-person meeting support: can it transcribe audio from live recordings or uploaded files, not just virtual calls?  
* Security and privacy: how is customer data handled on the platform?  
* Integrations: can it connect with your existing stack, like HubSpot, Notion, or Slack?  
* Functionality: does it go beyond transcriptions and actually help you take action?  
* Languages: can it transcribe and summarize meetings in different languages?  
* Desktop and mobile apps: can you access it on Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android for on-the-go meetings?  
* Recordings: is there support for saving and playing back audio and video recordings of meetings?    
## Evaluating Fireflies.ai and Otter.ai  
### Fireflies.ai
* Fireflies integrates with major video platforms through a bot, provides post-meeting summaries with action items, and includes features like keyword tracking and sentiment analysis. The service has limited free minutes and storage, shows transcription errors with accents, includes many features that can make the interface complex, and sends frequent email notifications.

### Otter.ai
* Otter offers direct Zoom integration, calendar sync, and live transcript editing with a generous free plan for transcription minutes. The service only works in English, struggles with accent recognition and rapid speech, and sometimes requires manual correction of speaker identification.  
## Comparison table    
Fireflies.ai makes sense for sales teams and companies who need to connect their meeting notes to other business tools, though its integration depth could be deeper and more actionable. The automation features and multi-language support help teams who deal with international clients or need to process many meetings quickly.

Otter.ai fits individual users and small teams who just want simple, reliable meeting transcription without much complexity, though it lacks meaningful ways to act on the captured information. Its straightforward approach and free plan make it accessible for students, journalists, and freelancers who mainly need English transcription.
