# Fireflies.ai vs. Otter.ai – Which should you choose?  
AI meeting notes platforms provide four primary deliverables:  
  
* Transcripts create a word-for-word record of the meeting. For example, a one-hour product development meeting generates a searchable document containing every feature discussion, technical requirement, and team decision.  
* Action items are pulled directly from the conversation. When someone says "John will update the wireframes by Friday," the AI automatically creates a tracked task with the assignee and deadline.  
* Meeting summaries distill hour-long conversations into 2-3 paragraphs. A 45-minute sprint planning meeting becomes a concise overview of sprint goals, resource allocation, and key decisions.  
* Topic segmentation breaks discussions into labeled sections. A client call covering multiple projects is automatically divided into sections like "Website Redesign," "Q1 Marketing Campaign," and "Budget Review."  
  
In addition to the quality of these deliverables, we'll want to look at a number of other key factors:  
  
* Free trial: can you test it for free before committing?  
* Ease-of-use: does it have a simple, intuitive setup that works for non-technical users?  
* In-person meeting support: can it transcribe audio from live recordings or uploaded files, not just virtual calls?  
* Security and privacy: how is customer data handled on the platform?  
* Integrations: can it connect with your existing stack, like HubSpot, Notion, or Slack?  
* Functionality: does it go beyond transcriptions and actually help you take action?  
* Languages: can it transcribe and summarize meetings in different languages?  
* Desktop and mobile apps: can you access it on Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android for on-the-go meetings?  
* Recordings: is there support for saving and playing back audio and video recordings of meetings?

Some people or companies might prefer Fireflies.ai for its integration with a wider range of tools like HubSpot and Notion, as well as its automation engine. However, both tools lack depth in integrations and may not fully assist users in meeting productivity needs. Fireflies.ai offers a free plan with limitations, while Otter.ai provides a completely free plan, making them accessible options for those looking to try out meeting transcription tools.

While Fireflies.ai and Otter.ai are user-friendly and offer Zoom and calendar integration, they both fall short in supporting in-person meetings and local recording. Additionally, Fireflies.ai supports multiple languages, whereas Otter.ai is limited to English only. Both tools are web-based without desktop apps, but they do offer mobile apps for iPhone and Android users.
