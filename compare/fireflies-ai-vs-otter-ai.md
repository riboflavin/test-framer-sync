# Fireflies.ai vs. Otter.ai – Which should you choose?  
AI meeting notes platforms provide four primary deliverables:  
  
* Transcripts create a word-for-word record of the meeting. For example, a one-hour product development meeting generates a searchable document containing every feature discussion, technical requirement, and team decision.  
* Action items are pulled directly from the conversation. When someone says "John will update the wireframes by Friday," the AI automatically creates a tracked task with the assignee and deadline.  
* Meeting summaries distill hour-long conversations into 2-3 paragraphs. A 45-minute sprint planning meeting becomes a concise overview of sprint goals, resource allocation, and key decisions.  
* Topic segmentation breaks discussions into labeled sections. A client call covering multiple projects is automatically divided into sections like "Website Redesign," "Q1 Marketing Campaign," and "Budget Review."  
  
In addition to the quality of these deliverables, we'll want to look at a number of other key factors:  
  
* Free trial: can you test it for free before committing?  
* Ease-of-use: does it have a simple, intuitive setup that works for non-technical users?  
* In-person meeting support: can it transcribe audio from live recordings or uploaded files, not just virtual calls?  
* Security and privacy: how is customer data handled on the platform?  
* Integrations: can it connect with your existing stack, like HubSpot, Notion, or Slack?  
* Functionality: does it go beyond transcriptions and actually help you take action?  
* Languages: can it transcribe and summarize meetings in different languages?  
* Desktop and mobile apps: can you access it on Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android for on-the-go meetings?  
* Recordings: is there support for saving and playing back audio and video recordings of meetings?    
## Evaluating Fireflies.ai and Otter.ai  
### Fireflies.ai
* Fireflies offers automated transcription with multi-language support, quick meeting summaries with action items, and integrations with project management tools and CRMs. The service includes a mobile app, works across platforms, and provides a free tier with basic features.
* The tool struggles with accent recognition and technical terms, sometimes produces overly general summaries that miss nuanced details, and gates advanced features like video recording behind paid tiers. Users report interface clutter and excessive notifications as minor issues.

### Otter.ai
* Otter provides real-time transcription with live highlighting and commenting features, generates AI summaries of key meeting themes, and includes a free tier with basic functionality. The service focuses on note-taking and meeting transcription across platforms.
* The service produces verbose transcripts that can lack clear structure, has accuracy issues with complex audio or speaker identification, and includes calendar management features that can lead to unwanted meeting joins. Free tier restrictions include a 40-minute limit on Zoom recordings.  
## Comparison table    
Fireflies.ai makes sense for global teams who need multiple language options and don't mind missing out on automation features. The tool works well enough for basic meeting transcription and note-taking, though its limited integration depth means you'll still need to do most of the post-meeting work manually.

Otter.ai fits better for English-speaking teams who want some basic automation to handle meeting follow-ups and task creation. While its automation features are helpful, the platform still requires significant manual effort to turn meeting content into meaningful action items and the integration ecosystem feels incomplete.
