## Why users switch away

### Avoma limitations
- Feels too complex for basic needs—described as "not a basic transcriber" but "a hefty platform"
- Experiences technical issues including minor bugs, delayed meeting joins, and speaker identification errors
- Charges premium prices that challenge smaller teams—free plan limits users to roughly 10 meetings monthly

### Fireflies.ai limitations
- Struggles with transcription accuracy for accents and technical jargon
- Generates high-level summaries that miss nuance and original phrasing
- Restricts valuable features to higher pricing tiers, forcing users into expensive plans

## Feature comparison

Avoma provides comprehensive meeting intelligence with organized notes and CRM integrations. It helps sales teams capture insights and automate follow-ups. While transcription accuracy impresses users, the platform can overwhelm those seeking simpler solutions.

Fireflies.ai offers streamlined recording and summarization across multiple platforms. It quickly delivers action items useful for follow-ups. Despite its user-friendly interface and accessible free tier, it produces generalized summaries and struggles with accented speech.

## Best fit

Avoma serves sales and customer success teams needing detailed meeting analysis. Higher pricing reflects robust features including CRM automation and follow-up emails. It organizes notes by topic and extracts actionable data from customer conversations, despite its complex interface.

Fireflies.ai fits general business users and smaller teams seeking affordable, straightforward assistance. With broader language support and accessible pricing, it works well for basic transcription needs. It lacks Avoma's deep automation but provides reliable transcripts and basic action tracking without overwhelming analytics.

## FAQs

**Do these tools work for in-person meetings?**
Yes, both work for in-person meetings. Avoma's mobile app records offline meetings for later transcription. Fireflies.ai's mobile app similarly records in-person meetings and voice notes.

**Do these tools require meeting bots?**
Fireflies.ai uses a bot participant ("Fred") that joins meetings to record and transcribe. Avoma automatically records online meetings, though it's unclear if this requires a meeting bot.

**How accurate are the transcriptions?**
Avoma users report approximately 95% accuracy even with jargon or accents. Fireflies.ai generally delivers good quality, even in other languages like Dutch, though accuracy decreases with heavy accents or technical terms.
