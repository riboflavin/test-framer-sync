# Avoma vs Fireflies.ai for meeting automation

Avoma is an AI meeting assistant that records, transcribes, and summarizes meetings. It breaks notes into organized topics like pain points and next steps, then generates actionable insights from conversations. The platform includes agenda templates, live note collaboration, and CRM integration with Salesforce and HubSpot. It works across both online and offline meetings through its mobile app, and offers transcription in over 20 languages with reported 95% accuracy even with jargon.

The system operates via a web-based platform with iOS and Android mobile apps but no desktop application. It includes automation for note-taking, follow-up emails, and CRM data entry. Pricing ranges from a limited free plan (approximately 10 meetings monthly) to paid tiers from $19 to $129 per user monthly. While comprehensive for sales and customer success teams, some users find it excessive for simple transcription needs, occasionally experience minor bugs with meeting joins, and note that higher pricing tiers can be expensive for small teams.

Fireflies.ai is a cloud-based AI meeting assistant that joins virtual meetings as a bot participant to record, transcribe, and summarize discussions across platforms like Zoom, Teams, and Google Meet. The core functionality includes speaker-labeled transcripts, AI-generated summaries of key points and action items, keyword searching of transcripts, and the AskFred chatbot for querying meeting content. It connects with external tools like Slack, Asana, and CRM systems, and offers a mobile app that can record in-person meetings.

The service operates on a tiered pricing model with a free forever plan offering limited credits, a Pro plan at approximately $10/user/month for unlimited audio recording and transcripts, and a Business plan at around $19/user/month adding video recording and analytics. Fireflies transcribes in over 100 languages but lacks a dedicated desktop application. Transcription accuracy can decrease with heavy accents or technical jargon, and some users report that the AI summaries sometimes miss nuance or specific phrasing from the original conversation.

## Comparing Avoma and Fireflies.ai

### Avoma

* Avoma functions as an all-in-one meeting tool that records, transcribes, and generates topic-based notes. Its integration with CRMs helps automate workflow but lacks depth in truly transforming meeting content into actionable tasks.

### Fireflies.ai

* Fireflies joins meetings as a bot participant across various platforms to provide transcripts and summaries with key points and action items. While it offers numerous integrations, it struggles with generating nuanced summaries that maintain context and drive meaningful post-meeting action.

Avoma suits larger sales and customer success teams that need deeper workflow automation and structured note organization. The platform's higher price point reflects its comprehensive feature set, though smaller teams might find it excessive for basic transcription needs.

Fireflies.ai works better for individuals and teams seeking a straightforward, affordable transcription tool across multiple platforms. Its broader language support and lower entry price make it accessible, but organizations requiring robust automation capabilities should consider its limitations in driving follow-through on meeting outcomes.

## Avoma vs Fireflies.ai: What do users say?

User reviews of Avoma highlight it as a comprehensive AI meeting assistant that records, transcribes, and summarizes meetings with approximately 95% accuracy, even handling jargon and accents. Users particularly appreciate how it saves time on administrative tasks, allowing them to focus on conversations rather than note-taking. Avoma's strong integration ecosystem with tools like Zoom, HubSpot, and Slack enhances workflows, while its responsive support team addresses user feedback. Some downsides mentioned include that it can be overkill for individual users with simple needs, occasional bugs or delays with the bot joining meetings, and dense transcripts that can be difficult to skim quickly. Higher-tier pricing may also be prohibitive for smaller teams.

Fireflies.ai receives praise for its simplicity and time-saving capabilities. Users report good transcription quality (even in languages beyond English) and appreciate how it delivers summaries and action items within minutes after calls. The tool works across multiple meeting platforms and offers helpful integrations with project management and CRM tools. However, some users desire more nuanced summaries, as Fireflies tends to generate high-level overviews that occasionally miss original phrasing or tone. Transcription accuracy can decrease with heavy accents or technical jargon, and some users find the interface cluttered or dislike the frequency of email notifications.
