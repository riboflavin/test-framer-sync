# Avoma vs. Granola: Which should you choose?
AI meeting notes platforms provide four primary deliverables:

• Transcripts create a word-for-word record of the meeting. For example, a one-hour product development meeting generates a searchable document containing every feature discussion, technical requirement, and team decision.
• Action items are pulled directly from the conversation. When someone says "John will update the wireframes by Friday," the AI automatically creates a tracked task with the assignee and deadline.
• Meeting summaries distill hour-long conversations into 2-3 paragraphs. A 45-minute sprint planning meeting becomes a concise overview of sprint goals, resource allocation, and key decisions.
• Topic segmentation breaks discussions into labeled sections. A client call covering multiple projects is automatically divided into sections like "Website Redesign," "Q1 Marketing Campaign," and "Budget Review."

In addition to the quality of these deliverables, we'll want to look at a number of other key factors:

• Free trial: can you test it for free before committing?
• Ease-of-use: does it have a simple, intuitive setup that works for non-technical users?
• In-person meeting support: can it transcribe audio from live recordings or uploaded files, not just virtual calls?
• Security and privacy: how is customer data handled on the platform?
• Integrations: can it connect with your existing stack, like HubSpot, Notion, or Slack?
• Functionality: does it go beyond transcriptions and actually help you take action?
• Languages: can it transcribe and summarize meetings in different languages?
• Desktop and mobile apps: can you access it on Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android for on-the-go meeitngs?
• Recordings: is there support for saving and playing back audio and video recordings of meetings?
## Evaluating Avoma and Granola
Avoma: Highly accurate transcriptions and AI summaries, clear speaker separation, and workflow integrations streamline follow-ups. However, no free tier, expensive advanced plans, complex for new users, and meeting bot issues.

Granola: Minimal, user-friendly app with custom templates, accurate transcription quality, and no meeting bot needed. However, MacOS only, limited integrations, lacks multi-user features, and some basic capabilities due to being a new product.

Avoma might appeal to companies looking for a tool with integrations to Zoom and calendar apps, as well as automation capabilities. However, its lack of support for in-person meetings and local recording could be limiting for users seeking a more comprehensive solution. Granola, on the other hand, offers a free trial and is easy to use, making it suitable for individuals or small businesses. Yet, its absence of deep integrations with popular platforms like HubSpot and Notion may hinder its ability to streamline meeting workflows effectively.
