# Avoma vs Granola – Feature and product comparison

AI meeting notes platforms provide four primary deliverables:
* Transcripts that create a word-for-word record of the meeting. For example, a one-hour product development meeting generates a searchable document containing every feature discussion, technical requirement, and team decision.
* Action items are pulled directly from the conversation. When someone says "John will update the wireframes by Friday," the AI automatically creates a tracked task with the assignee and deadline.
* Meeting summaries distill hour-long conversations into 2-3 paragraphs. A 45-minute sprint planning meeting becomes a concise overview of sprint goals, resource allocation, and key decisions.
* Topic segmentation breaks discussions into labeled sections. A client call covering multiple projects is automatically divided into sections like "Website Redesign," "Q1 Marketing Campaign," and "Budget Review."

In addition to the quality of these deliverables, we'll want to look at a number of other key factors:
* Ease-of-use: does it have a simple, intuitive setup that works for non-technical users?
* In-person meeting support: can it transcribe audio from live recordings or uploaded files, not just virtual calls?
* Security and privacy: how is customer data handled on the platform?
* Integrations: can it connect with your existing stack, like HubSpot, Notion, or Slack?
* Functionality: does it go beyond transcriptions and actually help you take action?
* Languages: can it transcribe and summarize meetings in different languages?
* Desktop and mobile apps: can you access it on Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android for on-the-go meetings?

## About Avoma
Avoma is an AI meeting assistant that records, transcribes, and summarizes meetings. It generates organized notes categorized by topics and actionable insights, with ~95% transcription accuracy even for technical jargon or accents. The platform supports agenda templates, note collaboration, CRM sync with Salesforce and HubSpot, and works for both online and in-person meetings via mobile. It operates across 20+ languages and includes a comprehensive integration ecosystem with Zoom, Slack and other tools.

The service is structured in tiers starting with a free plan (~10 meetings/month), then paid options from $19 to $129 per user monthly. While popular with sales and customer success teams for automatic call logging, some users find it unnecessarily complex for basic transcription needs. Occasional issues include delayed meeting joins, speaker identification errors, and dense transcripts that can be difficult to skim quickly. The platform functions through a web interface and mobile apps with no dedicated desktop application.

## About Granola
Granola is an AI notepad for meetings that runs locally on Mac computers. It captures meeting audio without requiring a bot to join calls, allowing users to make brief notes during conversations. When meetings end, Granola combines the audio recording with any user notes to produce structured summaries with sections like key takeaways and next steps. It works with all major meeting platforms by capturing system audio and offers customizable note templates.

The tool requires no setup for each meeting and functions offline on Mac with local recording and transcription. Pricing starts with a free trial of 25 meetings, followed by plans ranging from $18/month for individuals to $35/user/month for enterprise features. Current limitations include Mac-only support (no Windows version), no mobile apps yet, and limited integrations beyond calendar sync and Notion export. It supports approximately 16 languages but requires manual language selection.

## Comparison
### Avoma

* Avoma functions as an all-in-one meeting assistant that records, transcribes, and summarizes conversations. The platform offers organized notes with topic breakdowns, but lacks deeper integrations that would truly enhance productivity across workflows.

* While it provides CRM syncing and collaboration features that appeal to sales teams, many users find it unnecessarily complex for basic note-taking needs. Despite having mobile support and multiple integrations, Avoma still falls short on helping users effectively transform meeting content into meaningful action.

### Granola

* Granola operates as a local audio capture tool that listens to meetings without requiring a bot, converting brief user notes into structured summaries. The Mac-only desktop application processes meetings locally without intrusion, though its integration capabilities are limited and don't fully connect to users' existing workflows.

* Its simplified approach allows users to focus on conversations rather than note-taking, but the platform's limited ecosystem makes it difficult to translate captured information into executable tasks. Despite offering customizable templates, Granola struggles to deliver deeper automation that would truly enhance post-meeting productivity.

| Feature | Avoma | Granola |
|---------|-------|---------|
| In-person support | Full support ✅ | Partial support ❌ |
| Local recording | Yes ✅ | Yes ✅ |
| Integration depth | Basic CRM ❌ | Very limited ❌ |
| Automation | Basic workflows ✅ | Note-taking only ❌ |
| Language support | 20+ languages ✅ | 16 languages ✅ |
| Desktop app | No ❌ | Mac only ❌ |
| Mobile apps | Yes ✅ | No ❌ |
| Free tier | Yes ✅ | Trial only ❌ |

Avoma appears better suited for sales and customer success teams who need CRM integration and structured documentation of client interactions. Its mobile support and broader platform compatibility make it valuable for organizations that require flexibility across different meeting environments, though its complexity might overwhelm individuals seeking simpler solutions.

Granola might appeal more to Mac-using individuals or small teams who prefer a non-intrusive, locally-processed approach to meeting documentation. Its simplified interface and "set and forget" functionality works well for users who want clean, structured notes without the overhead of a complex platform, though its limited cross-platform support and integration capabilities could be restrictive for larger organizations with diverse technology needs.
