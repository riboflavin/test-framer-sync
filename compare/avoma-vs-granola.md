# Avoma vs. Granola – Which should you choose?  
AI meeting notes platforms provide four primary deliverables:  
  
* Transcripts create a word-for-word record of the meeting. For example, a one-hour product development meeting generates a searchable document containing every feature discussion, technical requirement, and team decision.  
* Action items are pulled directly from the conversation. When someone says "John will update the wireframes by Friday," the AI automatically creates a tracked task with the assignee and deadline.  
* Meeting summaries distill hour-long conversations into 2-3 paragraphs. A 45-minute sprint planning meeting becomes a concise overview of sprint goals, resource allocation, and key decisions.  
* Topic segmentation breaks discussions into labeled sections. A client call covering multiple projects is automatically divided into sections like "Website Redesign," "Q1 Marketing Campaign," and "Budget Review."  
  
In addition to the quality of these deliverables, we'll want to look at a number of other key factors:  
  
* Free trial: can you test it for free before committing?  
* Ease-of-use: does it have a simple, intuitive setup that works for non-technical users?  
* In-person meeting support: can it transcribe audio from live recordings or uploaded files, not just virtual calls?  
* Security and privacy: how is customer data handled on the platform?  
* Integrations: can it connect with your existing stack, like HubSpot, Notion, or Slack?  
* Functionality: does it go beyond transcriptions and actually help you take action?  
* Languages: can it transcribe and summarize meetings in different languages?  
* Desktop and mobile apps: can you access it on Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android for on-the-go meetings?  
* Recordings: is there support for saving and playing back audio and video recordings of meetings?    
## Evaluating Avoma and Granola  
### Avoma
* Avoma provides accurate transcription with speaker labels, AI summaries, and workflow integrations for CRM/calendar syncing. The platform captures meeting details comprehensively and enables structured follow-ups through its feature set.
* The service requires a paid subscription starting around $59-79/user/month, has no free tier, and presents a learning curve for new users due to its feature complexity. The meeting bot can occasionally join late or miss speaker identification.

### Granola
* Granola functions as a simple notepad that listens directly on the device without requiring a meeting bot, offers custom note templates, and provides accurate transcription to supplement manual notes. The app works independently of meeting platforms for more discreet operation.
* The tool is currently limited to MacOS, lacks extensive integrations, and doesn't support multi-user collaboration or advanced transcript editing. As a newer product, it operates primarily as a standalone solution for individual note-taking.  
## Comparison table    
Avoma makes sense for sales teams and companies who live in Zoom calls and need their meeting notes synced to HubSpot or Notion, though its web-only interface and limited integrations beyond the basics might frustrate power users. The tool's automation features help with repetitive tasks, but the learning curve means teams need time to get value from it.

Granola works better for individuals and small teams who have lots of in-person meetings or want to record local presentations, and don't need complex integrations. The Mac-only desktop app is simple to use, but the lack of mobile apps and basic integration options means users still need other tools to manage their meeting workflow.
