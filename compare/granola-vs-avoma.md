# Granola vs. Avoma: Which should you choose?
AI meeting notes platforms provide four primary deliverables:

• Transcripts create a word-for-word record of the meeting. For example, a one-hour product development meeting generates a searchable document containing every feature discussion, technical requirement, and team decision.
• Action items are pulled directly from the conversation. When someone says "John will update the wireframes by Friday," the AI automatically creates a tracked task with the assignee and deadline.
• Meeting summaries distill hour-long conversations into 2-3 paragraphs. A 45-minute sprint planning meeting becomes a concise overview of sprint goals, resource allocation, and key decisions.
• Topic segmentation breaks discussions into labeled sections. A client call covering multiple projects is automatically divided into sections like "Website Redesign," "Q1 Marketing Campaign," and "Budget Review."

In addition to the quality of these deliverables, we'll want to look at a number of other key factors:

• Free trial: can you test it for free before committing?
• Ease-of-use: does it have a simple, intuitive setup that works for non-technical users?
• In-person meeting support: can it transcribe audio from live recordings or uploaded files, not just virtual calls?
• Security and privacy: how is customer data handled on the platform?
• Integrations: can it connect with your existing stack, like HubSpot, Notion, or Slack?
• Functionality: does it go beyond transcriptions and actually help you take action?
• Languages: can it transcribe and summarize meetings in different languages?
• Desktop and mobile apps: can you access it on Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android for on-the-go meeitngs?
• Recordings: is there support for saving and playing back audio and video recordings of meetings?
## Evaluating Granola and Avoma
Granola: Pros - Minimal, user-friendly app with custom templates for tailored summaries. Accurate transcription quality helps fill in details you miss. Cons - MacOS only, few integrations, lacks multi-user features, and some capabilities are basic due to being a new product.

Granola might appeal to individuals or small businesses looking for a straightforward tool for in-person meetings and local recording, but may fall short for those needing deep integrations with other platforms like HubSpot or Notion. Avoma, on the other hand, could be a better fit for companies seeking a more automated solution with Zoom and calendar integration, despite lacking support for in-person meetings and local recording. Both tools, however, may not fully meet the needs of users looking for extensive integrations and practical assistance in conducting their meetings efficiently.
