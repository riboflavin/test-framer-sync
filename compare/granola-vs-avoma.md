# Granola vs. Avoma: Which should you choose?  
AI meeting notes platforms provide four primary deliverables:  
  
* Transcripts create a word-for-word record of the meeting. For example, a one-hour product development meeting generates a searchable document containing every feature discussion, technical requirement, and team decision.  
* Action items are pulled directly from the conversation. When someone says "John will update the wireframes by Friday," the AI automatically creates a tracked task with the assignee and deadline.  
* Meeting summaries distill hour-long conversations into 2-3 paragraphs. A 45-minute sprint planning meeting becomes a concise overview of sprint goals, resource allocation, and key decisions.  
* Topic segmentation breaks discussions into labeled sections. A client call covering multiple projects is automatically divided into sections like "Website Redesign," "Q1 Marketing Campaign," and "Budget Review."  
  
In addition to the quality of these deliverables, we'll want to look at a number of other key factors:  
  
* Free trial: can you test it for free before committing?  
* Ease-of-use: does it have a simple, intuitive setup that works for non-technical users?  
* In-person meeting support: can it transcribe audio from live recordings or uploaded files, not just virtual calls?  
* Security and privacy: how is customer data handled on the platform?  
* Integrations: can it connect with your existing stack, like HubSpot, Notion, or Slack?  
* Functionality: does it go beyond transcriptions and actually help you take action?  
* Languages: can it transcribe and summarize meetings in different languages?  
* Desktop and mobile apps: can you access it on Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android for on-the-go meetings?  
* Recordings: is there support for saving and playing back audio and video recordings of meetings?    
## Evaluating Granola and Avoma  
Granola:
- Pros: Minimal, user-friendly app with custom templates for notes and accurate transcription quality.

Avoma:
- Pros: Highly accurate transcriptions, excellent AI summaries, clear speaker separation, and workflow integrations.
- Cons: No free tier, expensive pricing for full features, complexity for new users, and occasional issues with meeting bot timing and speaker identification.

**Granola**: Companies or individuals looking for a straightforward tool for in-person meetings and local recording might find Granola appealing. However, its lack of integrations with popular platforms like HubSpot and Notion may limit its usefulness for those seeking a more comprehensive solution.

**Avoma**: Users who prioritize Zoom and calendar integration, as well as automation capabilities, may lean towards Avoma. Despite its user-friendly interface, the absence of support for in-person meetings and local recording could be a drawback for those looking for a more versatile tool.
