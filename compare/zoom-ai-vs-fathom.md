# Zoom AI vs. Fathom: Which should you choose?  
AI meeting notes platforms provide four primary deliverables:  
  
* Transcripts create a word-for-word record of the meeting. For example, a one-hour product development meeting generates a searchable document containing every feature discussion, technical requirement, and team decision.  
* Action items are pulled directly from the conversation. When someone says "John will update the wireframes by Friday," the AI automatically creates a tracked task with the assignee and deadline.  
* Meeting summaries distill hour-long conversations into 2-3 paragraphs. A 45-minute sprint planning meeting becomes a concise overview of sprint goals, resource allocation, and key decisions.  
* Topic segmentation breaks discussions into labeled sections. A client call covering multiple projects is automatically divided into sections like "Website Redesign," "Q1 Marketing Campaign," and "Budget Review."  
  
In addition to the quality of these deliverables, we'll want to look at a number of other key factors:  
  
* Free trial: can you test it for free before committing?  
* Ease-of-use: does it have a simple, intuitive setup that works for non-technical users?  
* In-person meeting support: can it transcribe audio from live recordings or uploaded files, not just virtual calls?  
* Security and privacy: how is customer data handled on the platform?  
* Integrations: can it connect with your existing stack, like HubSpot, Notion, or Slack?  
* Functionality: does it go beyond transcriptions and actually help you take action?  
* Languages: can it transcribe and summarize meetings in different languages?  
* Desktop and mobile apps: can you access it on Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android for on-the-go meetings?  
* Recordings: is there support for saving and playing back audio and video recordings of meetings?    
## Evaluating Zoom AI and Fathom  
Zoom AI:
- Pros: Native integration with Zoom, real-time Q&A during meetings, unique whiteboard AI, included with paid Zoom.
- Cons: Zoom-only functionality, no free access, speaker ID limits, no custom vocabulary support.

Fathom:
- Pros: Top-notch accuracy in transcripts, quick summaries, free core features, supports multiple languages.
- Cons: Historically Zoom-only, potential duplicate note issues, limited live collaboration, advanced features require paid plan.  
| Feature                           | Zoom AI               | Fathom               |
|-----------------------------------|-----------------------|----------------------|
| Trial/Free Plan                   | ❌ Requires paid Zoom  | ✅ Free unlimited plan|
| Zoom & Calendar Integration       | ✅ Zoom native         | ✅ Yes               |
| Easy to Use?                      | ✅ Yes                | ✅ Very easy         |
| Good for In-Person Meetings?      | ❌ No                 | ❌ No               |
| Good for Local Recording?         | ❌ No                 | ❌ No               |
| Integrates with HubSpot, Notion, etc.? | ❌ No            | ✅ Yes               |
| Automation Engine?                | ❌ No                 | ❌ No               |
| Language Support                  | ❌ English only       | ✅ Multiple languages|
| Desktop App                       | ❌ No                 | ❌ No (Web-based)    |
| iPhone & Android Apps             | ✅ Yes (Zoom app)     | ✅ Yes (Both)        |  
- Companies or individuals looking for a free option with calendar integration might consider Fathom due to its unlimited free plan and compatibility with Zoom and calendars. However, both tools lack deep integrations with popular platforms like HubSpot and Notion, limiting their usefulness for users who rely on these tools for productivity.

- While Zoom AI and Fathom are user-friendly and support multiple languages, they fall short in facilitating in-person meetings and local recording. Additionally, the absence of an automation engine in both tools may hinder users seeking to streamline their meeting processes and maximize efficiency.
