# Zoom AI vs. Fathom – Which should you choose?  
AI meeting notes platforms provide four primary deliverables:  
  
* Transcripts create a word-for-word record of the meeting. For example, a one-hour product development meeting generates a searchable document containing every feature discussion, technical requirement, and team decision.  
* Action items are pulled directly from the conversation. When someone says "John will update the wireframes by Friday," the AI automatically creates a tracked task with the assignee and deadline.  
* Meeting summaries distill hour-long conversations into 2-3 paragraphs. A 45-minute sprint planning meeting becomes a concise overview of sprint goals, resource allocation, and key decisions.  
* Topic segmentation breaks discussions into labeled sections. A client call covering multiple projects is automatically divided into sections like "Website Redesign," "Q1 Marketing Campaign," and "Budget Review."  
  
In addition to the quality of these deliverables, we'll want to look at a number of other key factors:  
  
* Free trial: can you test it for free before committing?  
* Ease-of-use: does it have a simple, intuitive setup that works for non-technical users?  
* In-person meeting support: can it transcribe audio from live recordings or uploaded files, not just virtual calls?  
* Security and privacy: how is customer data handled on the platform?  
* Integrations: can it connect with your existing stack, like HubSpot, Notion, or Slack?  
* Functionality: does it go beyond transcriptions and actually help you take action?  
* Languages: can it transcribe and summarize meetings in different languages?  
* Desktop and mobile apps: can you access it on Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android for on-the-go meetings?  
* Recordings: is there support for saving and playing back audio and video recordings of meetings?    
## Evaluating Zoom AI and Fathom  
### Zoom AI
* Zoom AI integrates natively with Zoom Chat and offers real-time meeting assistance, AI-powered whiteboarding, and comes included with paid Zoom subscriptions. The platform provides seamless meeting support and visual collaboration tools directly within the Zoom ecosystem.
* Zoom AI only works within Zoom's platform, requires a paid Zoom subscription, has limitations with speaker identification for non-logged-in users, and lacks custom vocabulary support for specialized terminology. These constraints affect its flexibility and accuracy in certain use cases.

### Fathom
* Fathom delivers accurate multi-speaker transcription, generates meeting summaries, offers free core features, and supports multiple languages with strong non-English performance. The service focuses on post-meeting documentation and analysis.
* Fathom has limited platform support beyond Zoom, can experience duplicate notes with multiple simultaneous users, lacks real-time collaboration features, and requires paid plans for advanced functionality. The tool emphasizes post-meeting outputs over live meeting support.  
## Comparison table    
Zoom AI makes sense for companies already heavily invested in Zoom who want the simplest possible meeting assistant that just works, without needing to think about it. The native integration and desktop apps are convenient for teams that prefer installed software, though the lack of third-party integrations and English-only support limit its usefulness.

Fathom appeals more to international teams and individual users who want a free solution that works with multiple tools and languages. The web-based approach and broader integration support give it more flexibility, but like Zoom AI, it lacks meaningful automation capabilities that could help users actually execute on meeting outcomes.
