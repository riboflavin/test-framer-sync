# Bluedot vs Krisp for meeting automation

Here's what you should look for in an AI meeting automation tool:  
* Transcripts that create a word-for-word record of the meeting. For example, a one-hour product development meeting generates a searchable document containing every feature discussion, technical requirement, and team decision.
* [Action items](/releases/add-action-items-to-meetings) are pulled directly from the conversation. When someone says "John will update the wireframes by Friday," the AI automatically creates a tracked task with the assignee and deadline.
* Meeting summaries distill hour-long conversations into 2-3 paragraphs. A 45-minute sprint planning meeting becomes a concise overview of sprint goals, resource allocation, and key decisions.
* Topic segmentation breaks discussions into labeled sections. A client call covering multiple projects is automatically divided into sections like "Website Redesign," "Q1 Marketing Campaign," and "Budget Review."

## Other key features
In addition to the quality of these deliverables, we'll want to look at a number of other key factors:
* Ease-of-use: does it have a simple, intuitive setup that works for non-technical users?
* In-person meeting support: can it transcribe audio from live recordings or uploaded files, not just virtual calls?
* Security and privacy: how is customer data handled on the platform?
* Integrations: can it connect with your existing stack, like HubSpot, Notion, or Slack?
* Functionality: does it go beyond transcriptions and actually help you take action?
* Languages: can it transcribe and summarize meetings in different languages?
* Desktop and mobile apps: can you access it on Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android for on-the-go meetings?

## Understanding Bluedot and Krisp
Bluedot is an AI meeting recorder and note-taker available as a Chrome extension that works with Google Meet, Zoom, Microsoft Teams, and other platforms. It captures meetings without requiring a bot, records transcripts in 100+ languages, and generates AI summaries that can be synced to various tools including Salesforce, HubSpot, Notion, and Google Docs. The tool functions in the background, allowing users to record meetings even when they're not the host.

The service operates on a tiered pricing model, starting with a limited free version (5 meetings total), then moving to paid plans: Basic (~$18/month for audio-only recordings), Pro (~$25/month adding video recording and custom templates), and Business (~$40/month with CRM integrations and unlimited imports). While praised for transcription accuracy and integration capabilities, its free tier is essentially just a trial, and it works best on Chrome desktop browsers with limited mobile support.

Krisp is a tool that combines noise cancellation with meeting assistant features. It removes background noises (dog barks, keyboard sounds, other voices) and echo from audio in real-time across communication apps by functioning as an audio filter. Beyond noise removal, Krisp offers meeting recording, transcription, and AI-generated summaries with key points and action items from conversations.

The software works through a desktop application available for Windows and Mac, supporting transcription in over 90 languages. It has a free plan with 60 minutes of daily noise cancellation and limited meeting summaries, while paid plans (starting at $8/month annually) provide unlimited noise cancellation and meeting notes. Krisp operates locally without requiring a meeting bot, can record both online and offline conversations, and offers limited integrations including calendar and HubSpot CRM connectivity.

## Comparing Bluedot and Krisp

### Bluedot

* Bluedot offers a Chrome extension that records and transcribes meetings across platforms without requiring a bot, providing accurate transcription in over 100 languages. Its limited free tier and higher paid plans restrict access to features like longer recordings and custom templates.

* The tool integrates with CRMs and project management tools for one-click syncing, which saves manual work but falls short on deeper workflow automation. While praised for transcription accuracy, Bluedot's reliance on Chrome and lack of mobile support may limit its utility for teams seeking comprehensive meeting solutions.

### Krisp

* Krisp combines noise cancellation technology with meeting recording and AI summaries, functioning across communication platforms without requiring meeting bots. The free plan limits noise cancellation to 60 minutes daily while paid plans offer unlimited usage but at costs some find steep.

* Users appreciate Krisp's reliable noise removal and accurate meeting summaries, though occasional audio distortion and high CPU usage are reported drawbacks. Despite offering calendar and CRM integrations, Krisp's limited workflow automation capabilities prevent it from being a complete meeting productivity solution.

| Feature | Bluedot | Krisp |
|---------|---------|-------|
| Transcription accuracy | High precision ✅ | Good with limitations ✅ |
| Free tier | 5 meetings only ❌ | Daily limits ✅ |
| Pricing | $14-40/month ❌ | $8-15/month ✅ |
| No-bot recording | Chrome extension ✅ | Audio filter ✅ |
| Integration depth | Basic syncing ❌ | Limited connections ❌ |
| Language support | 100+ languages ✅ | 95+ languages ✅ |
| Workflow automation | Basic actions ❌ | Task delegation ❌ |
| Mobile support | Not available ❌ | Not available ❌ |
| Noise cancellation | Not featured ❌ | Core feature ✅ |

Bluedot serves teams that prioritize accurate transcription and seamless integration with external tools like Notion and Salesforce. It works best for sales teams, researchers, and professionals who need reliable meeting records they can quickly sync to other platforms. The higher price point reflects its focus on transcription quality and integration capabilities rather than audio enhancement.

Krisp appeals to users in noisy environments who need both clear audio and decent note-taking. Its lower price point makes it accessible for individual professionals and small teams, especially those taking calls from home offices or public spaces. The dual functionality of noise cancellation and meeting summaries provides value, though users seeking deeper workflow automation or comprehensive CRM integration might find both tools lacking in fully transforming meeting outputs into actionable work.
