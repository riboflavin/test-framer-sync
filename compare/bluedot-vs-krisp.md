# Bluedot vs. Krisp – Which should you choose?  
AI meeting notes platforms provide four primary deliverables:  
  
* Transcripts create a word-for-word record of the meeting. For example, a one-hour product development meeting generates a searchable document containing every feature discussion, technical requirement, and team decision.  
* Action items are pulled directly from the conversation. When someone says "John will update the wireframes by Friday," the AI automatically creates a tracked task with the assignee and deadline.  
* Meeting summaries distill hour-long conversations into 2-3 paragraphs. A 45-minute sprint planning meeting becomes a concise overview of sprint goals, resource allocation, and key decisions.  
* Topic segmentation breaks discussions into labeled sections. A client call covering multiple projects is automatically divided into sections like "Website Redesign," "Q1 Marketing Campaign," and "Budget Review."  
  
In addition to the quality of these deliverables, we'll want to look at a number of other key factors:  
  
* Free trial: can you test it for free before committing?  
* Ease-of-use: does it have a simple, intuitive setup that works for non-technical users?  
* In-person meeting support: can it transcribe audio from live recordings or uploaded files, not just virtual calls?  
* Security and privacy: how is customer data handled on the platform?  
* Integrations: can it connect with your existing stack, like HubSpot, Notion, or Slack?  
* Functionality: does it go beyond transcriptions and actually help you take action?  
* Languages: can it transcribe and summarize meetings in different languages?  
* Desktop and mobile apps: can you access it on Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android for on-the-go meetings?  
* Recordings: is there support for saving and playing back audio and video recordings of meetings?    
## Evaluating Bluedot and Krisp  
### Bluedot
* Offers accurate transcription without requiring bot invites, works in background across major platforms, and auto-syncs notes to common apps. Free tier limited to 5 meetings lifetime, requires Chrome for best performance, and some users find higher tier pricing expensive.

### Krisp
* Provides noise cancellation with AI note-taking capabilities, offering one-click controls and meeting summaries with action items. Free tier caps noise removal at 60 minutes daily, can occasionally distort audio or use high CPU resources, and some users report slow support response times.  
## Comparison table    
Bluedot makes sense for teams who need to automate parts of their meeting workflow and want basic integrations with common tools, though the integration options are still quite limited. The automation features could save time for teams who hold lots of meetings, but the lack of mobile apps means you're stuck at your desk to use it.

Krisp works well for people who just want simple meeting recording and transcription without much fuss, though you won't get any automation features and the integrations are basic at best. The desktop-only approach and limited feature set means it's best for individual users or small teams who don't need their meeting tool to do much beyond capture and store conversations.
