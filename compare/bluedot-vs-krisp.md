# Bluedot vs Krisp for meeting automation

Bluedot is an AI meeting recorder and note-taker available as a Chrome extension that works with Google Meet, Zoom, Microsoft Teams, and other platforms. It captures meetings without requiring a bot, records transcripts in 100+ languages, and generates AI summaries that can be synced to various tools including Salesforce, HubSpot, Notion, and Google Docs. The tool functions in the background, allowing users to record meetings even when they're not the host.

The service operates on a tiered pricing model, starting with a limited free version (5 meetings total), then moving to paid plans: Basic (~$18/month for audio-only recordings), Pro (~$25/month adding video recording and custom templates), and Business (~$40/month with CRM integrations and unlimited imports). While praised for transcription accuracy and integration capabilities, its free tier is essentially just a trial, and it works best on Chrome desktop browsers with limited mobile support.

Krisp is a tool that combines noise cancellation with meeting assistant features. It removes background noises (dog barks, keyboard sounds, other voices) and echo from audio in real-time across communication apps by functioning as an audio filter. Beyond noise removal, Krisp offers meeting recording, transcription, and AI-generated summaries with key points and action items from conversations.

The software works through a desktop application available for Windows and Mac, supporting transcription in over 90 languages. It has a free plan with 60 minutes of daily noise cancellation and limited meeting summaries, while paid plans (starting at $8/month annually) provide unlimited noise cancellation and meeting notes. Krisp operates locally without requiring a meeting bot, can record both online and offline conversations, and offers limited integrations including calendar and HubSpot CRM connectivity.

## Comparing Bluedot and Krisp

### Bluedot

* Bluedot offers a Chrome extension that records and transcribes meetings across platforms without requiring a bot, providing accurate transcription in over 100 languages. Its limited free tier and higher paid plans restrict access to features like longer recordings and custom templates.

* The tool integrates with CRMs and project management tools for one-click syncing, which saves manual work but falls short on deeper workflow automation. While praised for transcription accuracy, Bluedot's reliance on Chrome and lack of mobile support may limit its utility for teams seeking comprehensive meeting solutions.

### Krisp

* Krisp combines noise cancellation technology with meeting recording and AI summaries, functioning across communication platforms without requiring meeting bots. The free plan limits noise cancellation to 60 minutes daily while paid plans offer unlimited usage but at costs some find steep.

* Users appreciate Krisp's reliable noise removal and accurate meeting summaries, though occasional audio distortion and high CPU usage are reported drawbacks. Despite offering calendar and CRM integrations, Krisp's limited workflow automation capabilities prevent it from being a complete meeting productivity solution.

Bluedot serves teams that prioritize accurate transcription and seamless integration with external tools like Notion and Salesforce. It works best for sales teams, researchers, and professionals who need reliable meeting records they can quickly sync to other platforms. The higher price point reflects its focus on transcription quality and integration capabilities rather than audio enhancement.

Krisp appeals to users in noisy environments who need both clear audio and decent note-taking. Its lower price point makes it accessible for individual professionals and small teams, especially those taking calls from home offices or public spaces. The dual functionality of noise cancellation and meeting summaries provides value, though users seeking deeper workflow automation or comprehensive CRM integration might find both tools lacking in fully transforming meeting outputs into actionable work.

## Bluedot vs Krisp: What do users say?

Bluedot is an AI meeting recorder and note-taker that works through a Chrome extension without requiring a meeting bot. Users praise it for having exceptional transcription accuracy across all major meeting platforms like Zoom, Google Meet, and Microsoft Teams. It offers seamless integration with CRMs, project tools, and document systems for automatic note syncing. Bluedot supports over 100 languages and provides discreet background recording that doesn't require being the meeting host. However, users note significant limitations in the free version (only 5 lifetime meetings), and the best experience requires Chrome on desktop. Some advanced features require higher-tier plans, and pricing at Pro/Business levels can be steep for small teams.

Krisp is primarily a noise cancellation tool that has evolved to include meeting transcription and summarization features. It excels at removing background noises like dog barks, keyboard typing, and echo from audio in real-time across virtually all communication apps. Users consistently report that Krisp "just works" for eliminating unwanted sounds, making it essential for remote workers in noisy environments. Recently added AI note-taking features generate structured summaries with key points and action items. Drawbacks include occasional audio distortion, limited free plan usage (60 minutes daily), high CPU usage, and pricing that some find expensive if only one feature is needed.

## FAQs 
• Would Bluedot work for in-person meetings? What about Krisp?
Both Bluedot and Krisp work for in-person meetings. Bluedot's bot-free recorder can capture any meeting on your device, and Krisp captures any conversation (online or offline) using noise-canceling audio on your device.

• What about meeting bots? Does either of these tools require a meeting bot?
Neither tool requires a meeting bot. Bluedot is specifically noted as not requiring a bot to join calls (a Chrome extension is used instead), which users appreciate because there's "no awkward bot presence in meetings." Krisp also doesn't use a bot - it records and transcribes meetings locally via the Krisp app.

• What do users say about the quality of transcriptions?
Bluedot is widely praised for transcription accuracy - marketing and early users often note it as "the most accurate" AI notetaker they've tried. For Krisp, one user noted the summaries with key points and action items were "extremely accurate," requiring minimal edits. However, some Krisp users report that occasional audio quirks (when Krisp distorts voices or clips words) can affect transcription accuracy.
