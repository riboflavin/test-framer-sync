# Bluedot vs. Krisp – Which should you choose?  
AI meeting notes platforms provide four primary deliverables:  
  
* Transcripts create a word-for-word record of the meeting. For example, a one-hour product development meeting generates a searchable document containing every feature discussion, technical requirement, and team decision.  
* Action items are pulled directly from the conversation. When someone says "John will update the wireframes by Friday," the AI automatically creates a tracked task with the assignee and deadline.  
* Meeting summaries distill hour-long conversations into 2-3 paragraphs. A 45-minute sprint planning meeting becomes a concise overview of sprint goals, resource allocation, and key decisions.  
* Topic segmentation breaks discussions into labeled sections. A client call covering multiple projects is automatically divided into sections like "Website Redesign," "Q1 Marketing Campaign," and "Budget Review."  
  
In addition to the quality of these deliverables, we'll want to look at a number of other key factors:  
  
* Free trial: can you test it for free before committing?  
* Ease-of-use: does it have a simple, intuitive setup that works for non-technical users?  
* In-person meeting support: can it transcribe audio from live recordings or uploaded files, not just virtual calls?  
* Security and privacy: how is customer data handled on the platform?  
* Integrations: can it connect with your existing stack, like HubSpot, Notion, or Slack?  
* Functionality: does it go beyond transcriptions and actually help you take action?  
* Languages: can it transcribe and summarize meetings in different languages?  
* Desktop and mobile apps: can you access it on Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android for on-the-go meetings?  
* Recordings: is there support for saving and playing back audio and video recordings of meetings?    
## Evaluating Bluedot and Krisp  
### Bluedot
* Offers accurate transcription without requiring bot invites, works in background across major platforms, and auto-syncs notes to common apps. Free tier limited to 5 meetings lifetime, requires Chrome for best performance, and some users find higher tier pricing expensive.

### Krisp
* Provides noise cancellation with AI note-taking capabilities, offering one-click controls and meeting summaries with action items. Free tier caps noise removal at 60 minutes daily, can occasionally distort audio or use high CPU resources, and some users report slow support response times.  
## Comparison table    
Small teams and startups who need basic meeting recording and transcription would find Krisp sufficient for their needs, though they may outgrow its limited integration options. The simple interface and straightforward feature set make it a logical choice for those just starting to formalize their meeting processes.

Larger organizations and teams with more complex workflows would gravitate toward Bluedot's automation capabilities and broader feature set, despite its incomplete ecosystem of integrations. The ability to automate post-meeting tasks and handle more sophisticated use cases makes it more suitable for established teams, even though users still need to handle many meeting-related tasks manually.
