# Otter.ai vs. Fireflies.ai – Which should you choose?  
AI meeting notes platforms provide four primary deliverables:  
  
* Transcripts create a word-for-word record of the meeting. For example, a one-hour product development meeting generates a searchable document containing every feature discussion, technical requirement, and team decision.  
* Action items are pulled directly from the conversation. When someone says "John will update the wireframes by Friday," the AI automatically creates a tracked task with the assignee and deadline.  
* Meeting summaries distill hour-long conversations into 2-3 paragraphs. A 45-minute sprint planning meeting becomes a concise overview of sprint goals, resource allocation, and key decisions.  
* Topic segmentation breaks discussions into labeled sections. A client call covering multiple projects is automatically divided into sections like "Website Redesign," "Q1 Marketing Campaign," and "Budget Review."  
  
In addition to the quality of these deliverables, we'll want to look at a number of other key factors:  
  
* Free trial: can you test it for free before committing?  
* Ease-of-use: does it have a simple, intuitive setup that works for non-technical users?  
* In-person meeting support: can it transcribe audio from live recordings or uploaded files, not just virtual calls?  
* Security and privacy: how is customer data handled on the platform?  
* Integrations: can it connect with your existing stack, like HubSpot, Notion, or Slack?  
* Functionality: does it go beyond transcriptions and actually help you take action?  
* Languages: can it transcribe and summarize meetings in different languages?  
* Desktop and mobile apps: can you access it on Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android for on-the-go meetings?  
* Recordings: is there support for saving and playing back audio and video recordings of meetings?

## Comparison table    
Some individuals or organizations may find Otter.ai appealing due to its free plan, Zoom and calendar integration, and ease of use. However, both tools lack deep integrations with popular platforms like HubSpot and Notion, limiting their ability to enhance meeting productivity. Additionally, Otter.ai and Fireflies.ai fall short in supporting in-person meetings and local recording, which may deter users seeking comprehensive meeting solutions.

While Fireflies.ai offers features like automation engine and multi-language support, its limitations in integration depth and meeting functionality may hinder its effectiveness for certain users or businesses. Both tools lack desktop applications and rely solely on web-based platforms, potentially limiting their accessibility and usability for individuals who prefer desktop interfaces. Despite offering mobile apps for both iPhone and Android, Otter.ai and Fireflies.ai may not fully meet the needs of users looking for comprehensive meeting solutions that seamlessly integrate with their existing workflows.
