# Otter.ai vs. Fireflies.ai – Which should you choose?  
AI meeting notes platforms provide four primary deliverables:  
  
* Transcripts create a word-for-word record of the meeting. For example, a one-hour product development meeting generates a searchable document containing every feature discussion, technical requirement, and team decision.  
* Action items are pulled directly from the conversation. When someone says "John will update the wireframes by Friday," the AI automatically creates a tracked task with the assignee and deadline.  
* Meeting summaries distill hour-long conversations into 2-3 paragraphs. A 45-minute sprint planning meeting becomes a concise overview of sprint goals, resource allocation, and key decisions.  
* Topic segmentation breaks discussions into labeled sections. A client call covering multiple projects is automatically divided into sections like "Website Redesign," "Q1 Marketing Campaign," and "Budget Review."  
  
In addition to the quality of these deliverables, we'll want to look at a number of other key factors:  
  
* Free trial: can you test it for free before committing?  
* Ease-of-use: does it have a simple, intuitive setup that works for non-technical users?  
* In-person meeting support: can it transcribe audio from live recordings or uploaded files, not just virtual calls?  
* Security and privacy: how is customer data handled on the platform?  
* Integrations: can it connect with your existing stack, like HubSpot, Notion, or Slack?  
* Functionality: does it go beyond transcriptions and actually help you take action?  
* Languages: can it transcribe and summarize meetings in different languages?  
* Desktop and mobile apps: can you access it on Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android for on-the-go meetings?  
* Recordings: is there support for saving and playing back audio and video recordings of meetings?

Some individuals or organizations may find Otter.ai appealing due to its free plan and integration with Zoom and calendars. However, both tools lack deep integrations with popular platforms like HubSpot and Notion, potentially limiting their usefulness for certain users. Additionally, while Fireflies.ai offers an automation engine, Otter.ai falls short in this aspect, which may hinder users looking to streamline their meeting processes.

Although both tools are user-friendly and support multiple languages, they do not cater well to in-person meetings or local recording needs. The absence of a desktop app for both Otter.ai and Fireflies.ai could also be a drawback for users seeking a more comprehensive meeting solution. Ultimately, individuals or companies looking for tools with robust integrations and advanced automation capabilities may need to explore other options beyond Otter.ai and Fireflies.ai.
