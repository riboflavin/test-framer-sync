# Granola vs. Zoom AI – Which should you choose?  
AI meeting notes platforms provide four primary deliverables:  
  
* Transcripts create a word-for-word record of the meeting. For example, a one-hour product development meeting generates a searchable document containing every feature discussion, technical requirement, and team decision.  
* Action items are pulled directly from the conversation. When someone says "John will update the wireframes by Friday," the AI automatically creates a tracked task with the assignee and deadline.  
* Meeting summaries distill hour-long conversations into 2-3 paragraphs. A 45-minute sprint planning meeting becomes a concise overview of sprint goals, resource allocation, and key decisions.  
* Topic segmentation breaks discussions into labeled sections. A client call covering multiple projects is automatically divided into sections like "Website Redesign," "Q1 Marketing Campaign," and "Budget Review."  
  
In addition to the quality of these deliverables, we'll want to look at a number of other key factors:  
  
* Free trial: can you test it for free before committing?  
* Ease-of-use: does it have a simple, intuitive setup that works for non-technical users?  
* In-person meeting support: can it transcribe audio from live recordings or uploaded files, not just virtual calls?  
* Security and privacy: how is customer data handled on the platform?  
* Integrations: can it connect with your existing stack, like HubSpot, Notion, or Slack?  
* Functionality: does it go beyond transcriptions and actually help you take action?  
* Languages: can it transcribe and summarize meetings in different languages?  
* Desktop and mobile apps: can you access it on Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android for on-the-go meetings?  
* Recordings: is there support for saving and playing back audio and video recordings of meetings?    
## Evaluating Granola and Zoom AI  
### Granola
* Granola functions as a device-level note-taking tool that works across meeting platforms by listening locally, with custom templates for summaries and accurate transcription to capture missed details. The app is currently MacOS-only with limited integrations, lacks multi-user features, and offers basic transcript editing capabilities as a new product still in development.

### Zoom AI
* Zoom AI integrates directly with Zoom meetings, providing real-time Q&A, whiteboard AI for diagrams, and automatic output in Zoom Chat at no extra cost for paid subscribers. The tool only works within Zoom's platform, requires a paid Zoom subscription, has limitations with non-logged-in speakers, and lacks custom vocabulary for specialized terminology.  
## Comparison table    
Small teams and freelancers who run a lot of in-person meetings or want to record local conversations would find Granola useful, despite its limited integrations. The free plan and Mac-only desktop app make it accessible for trying out, though users might outgrow its capabilities as their needs become more complex.

Zoom-heavy organizations who already pay for Zoom and need mobile access would naturally gravitate toward Zoom AI, given its native integration. The lack of support for in-person meetings and limited third-party integrations means it's best suited for teams who primarily conduct remote meetings and don't need extensive workflow automation.
