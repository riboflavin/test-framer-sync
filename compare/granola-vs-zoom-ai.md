# Granola vs. Zoom AI – Which should you choose?  
AI meeting notes platforms provide four primary deliverables:  
  
* Transcripts create a word-for-word record of the meeting. For example, a one-hour product development meeting generates a searchable document containing every feature discussion, technical requirement, and team decision.  
* Action items are pulled directly from the conversation. When someone says "John will update the wireframes by Friday," the AI automatically creates a tracked task with the assignee and deadline.  
* Meeting summaries distill hour-long conversations into 2-3 paragraphs. A 45-minute sprint planning meeting becomes a concise overview of sprint goals, resource allocation, and key decisions.  
* Topic segmentation breaks discussions into labeled sections. A client call covering multiple projects is automatically divided into sections like "Website Redesign," "Q1 Marketing Campaign," and "Budget Review."  
  
In addition to the quality of these deliverables, we'll want to look at a number of other key factors:  
  
* Free trial: can you test it for free before committing?  
* Ease-of-use: does it have a simple, intuitive setup that works for non-technical users?  
* In-person meeting support: can it transcribe audio from live recordings or uploaded files, not just virtual calls?  
* Security and privacy: how is customer data handled on the platform?  
* Integrations: can it connect with your existing stack, like HubSpot, Notion, or Slack?  
* Functionality: does it go beyond transcriptions and actually help you take action?  
* Languages: can it transcribe and summarize meetings in different languages?  
* Desktop and mobile apps: can you access it on Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android for on-the-go meetings?  
* Recordings: is there support for saving and playing back audio and video recordings of meetings?    
## Evaluating Granola and Zoom AI  
### Granola
* Granola operates as a background note-taking tool that captures and formats meeting notes without user intervention, with a clean interface similar to Apple Notes and customizable templates for organizing summaries. The tool runs discreetly without interrupting meetings and relies on system audio capture for transcription.
* Currently limited to Mac devices with no Windows or mobile support, and notes are only accessible via desktop app or web interface. Audio capture may not function with certain meeting room hardware setups, and as a newer tool, it has some minor feature gaps.

### Zoom AI
* Zoom AI integrates directly into the Zoom platform with no additional setup required, automatically tracking meeting content and generating instant summaries with action items, and comes included with paid Zoom accounts. The tool operates entirely within the Zoom ecosystem and provides immediate post-meeting content.
* Limited to Zoom meetings only and unavailable for free account users beyond 40-minute sessions, with basic chat integration and occasional difficulties sharing notes outside Zoom. Meeting management features are less comprehensive compared to dedicated tools.  
## Comparison table    
Granola works best for small teams and startups who need basic meeting tools and want to try before buying. The lack of mobile apps and limited integration options mean users need to be comfortable with desktop-only use and manual workflows.

Zoom AI appeals to larger organizations that already use Zoom and want AI features without switching platforms. While it offers mobile support and enterprise-grade features, the absence of a trial period and weak integration capabilities may frustrate teams looking to streamline their meeting processes.
