# Granola vs. Zoom AI: Which should you choose?
AI meeting notes platforms provide four primary deliverables:

• Transcripts create a word-for-word record of the meeting. For example, a one-hour product development meeting generates a searchable document containing every feature discussion, technical requirement, and team decision.
• Action items are pulled directly from the conversation. When someone says "John will update the wireframes by Friday," the AI automatically creates a tracked task with the assignee and deadline.
• Meeting summaries distill hour-long conversations into 2-3 paragraphs. A 45-minute sprint planning meeting becomes a concise overview of sprint goals, resource allocation, and key decisions.
• Topic segmentation breaks discussions into labeled sections. A client call covering multiple projects is automatically divided into sections like "Website Redesign," "Q1 Marketing Campaign," and "Budget Review."

In addition to the quality of these deliverables, we'll want to look at a number of other key factors:

• Free trial: can you test it for free before committing?
• Ease-of-use: does it have a simple, intuitive setup that works for non-technical users?
• In-person meeting support: can it transcribe audio from live recordings or uploaded files, not just virtual calls?
• Security and privacy: how is customer data handled on the platform?
• Integrations: can it connect with your existing stack, like HubSpot, Notion, or Slack?
• Functionality: does it go beyond transcriptions and actually help you take action?
• Languages: can it transcribe and summarize meetings in different languages?
• Desktop and mobile apps: can you access it on Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android for on-the-go meeitngs?
• Recordings: is there support for saving and playing back audio and video recordings of meetings?
## Evaluating Granola and Zoom AI
Granola:
- Pros: Minimal, user-friendly app with custom templates for notes and accurate transcription quality.
- Cons: MacOS only, few integrations, lacks multi-user features, and some capabilities are basic due to being a new product.

Zoom AI:
- Pros: Native integration with Zoom, real-time Q&A during meetings, unique whiteboard AI, and included with paid Zoom subscriptions.
- Cons: Zoom-only functionality, requires a paid Zoom plan, speaker ID limits, and no custom vocabulary support.
In general, users say that Granola: - Minimal, user-friendly app – feels like a regular notepad​ddiy.co
.
- No meeting bot needed, works on any platform by listening on device (more discreet).
- Custom templates for notes yield tailored summaries​ddiy.co
.
- Accurate transcription quality helps fill in details you miss​ddiy.co
.. However, they also say: - MacOS only (Windows version in waitlist; no mobile app yet)​deepgram.com

.
- Few integrations currently; mostly a standalone tool​ddiy.co
.
- Lacks multi-user features – designed for individual note-taking (you manually share notes after).
- New product – still adding features, so some capabilities (editing transcripts, etc.) are basic..
In general, users say that Zoom AI: - Native integration – no setup if you use Zoom, and outputs appear right in Zoom Chat​meetjamie.ai
.
- Real-time Q&A and assistance during meetings (ask the AI on the fly).
- Unique whiteboard AI for creating mind-maps/diagrams in meeting​meetjamie.ai
.
- Included with paid Zoom (no extra fee for existing Zoom subscribers)​news.zoom.us
.. However, they also say: - Zoom-only: Doesn’t work on Google Meet, Teams, etc.​meetjamie.ai
.
- No free access – requires a Zoom paid plan (~$15+ monthly)​meetjamie.ai
.
- Speaker ID limits: won’t capture anyone not logged in as Zoom user (e.g., a speaker in the room)​meetjamie.ai
.
- No custom vocabulary, so industry jargon may transcribe poorly​meetjamie.ai

Granola might appeal to individuals or small businesses looking for a simple and free tool for managing meetings, especially if they prioritize ease of use and in-person meeting capabilities. However, its lack of integrations with popular platforms like HubSpot and Notion may limit its usefulness for those seeking a more comprehensive solution.

On the other hand, Zoom AI could be a better fit for larger companies or teams that heavily rely on Zoom for their meetings, as it offers native integration with Zoom and a user-friendly interface. Nevertheless, its limited integrations and absence of an automation engine may hinder its ability to truly streamline meeting processes and enhance productivity for users.
