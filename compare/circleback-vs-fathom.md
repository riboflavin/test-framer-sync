# Circleback vs. Fathom – Which should you choose?  
AI meeting notes platforms provide four primary deliverables:  
  
* Transcripts create a word-for-word record of the meeting. For example, a one-hour product development meeting generates a searchable document containing every feature discussion, technical requirement, and team decision.  
* Action items are pulled directly from the conversation. When someone says "John will update the wireframes by Friday," the AI automatically creates a tracked task with the assignee and deadline.  
* Meeting summaries distill hour-long conversations into 2-3 paragraphs. A 45-minute sprint planning meeting becomes a concise overview of sprint goals, resource allocation, and key decisions.  
* Topic segmentation breaks discussions into labeled sections. A client call covering multiple projects is automatically divided into sections like "Website Redesign," "Q1 Marketing Campaign," and "Budget Review."  
  
In addition to the quality of these deliverables, we'll want to look at a number of other key factors:  
  
* Free trial: can you test it for free before committing?  
* Ease-of-use: does it have a simple, intuitive setup that works for non-technical users?  
* In-person meeting support: can it transcribe audio from live recordings or uploaded files, not just virtual calls?  
* Security and privacy: how is customer data handled on the platform?  
* Integrations: can it connect with your existing stack, like HubSpot, Notion, or Slack?  
* Functionality: does it go beyond transcriptions and actually help you take action?  
* Languages: can it transcribe and summarize meetings in different languages?  
* Desktop and mobile apps: can you access it on Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android for on-the-go meetings?  
* Recordings: is there support for saving and playing back audio and video recordings of meetings?    
## Evaluating Circleback and Fathom  
### Circleback
* Provides automated meeting notes within minutes and integrates with calendars, Slack, and CRM systems. Setup is straightforward and summaries include highlighted action items and key points.
* Limited feature set excludes video recording capabilities, and as a newer tool, some functionality is still in development.

### Fathom
* Offers quick transcription with AI summaries, multiple summary formats, and a generous free tier with core features. Interface focuses on live meeting capture without external audio file support.
* Requires paid plans for advanced features like meeting templates, lacks a mobile app, and includes on-screen elements that some find distracting during calls.  
## Comparison table    
Circleback works better for companies that need to handle both in-person and remote meetings, and who want their teams to be able to capture and process meetings from anywhere using mobile devices. The local recording capability also makes it a good fit for organizations with strict security requirements or unreliable internet connections.

Fathom is more suited to remote-first companies and individual professionals who primarily conduct their meetings through video calls and don't need mobile access. Their desktop-focused approach and partial local recording makes them a simpler choice for users who don't need the full range of meeting capture scenarios, though like Circleback, their integrations and automation could go deeper.
