# Fathom vs Zoom AI for meeting automation

Fathom is an AI meeting notetaker that integrates with Zoom, Google Meet, and Microsoft Teams. It records and transcribes meetings in real-time across 25+ languages, then produces AI summaries in various formats including bullet lists, action items, and detailed chronological summaries. The system identifies speakers, allows users to tag key moments during calls, and offers post-meeting features like meeting overviews and draft follow-up emails. Users can query meeting content through an AI Q&A feature.

Fathom offers a free plan with unlimited recordings and full AI summaries for 5 meetings monthly. Paid tiers range from $15/month for individuals to $29/user/month for team collaboration with advanced CRM integrations. The service requires a desktop app and doesn't support external audio uploads or mobile access. While it automatically syncs with platforms like HubSpot and Salesforce, some users note that advanced capabilities like meeting templates are restricted to higher-tier plans.

Zoom AI is an integrated feature within the Zoom platform that automatically generates meeting summaries and action items after calls. It allows participants to ask questions during meetings, supports composing emails and documents related to meetings, and works directly within the Zoom interface without requiring additional setup. It's included at no extra cost for paid Zoom subscribers.

The tool only functions within Zoom meetings and isn't available for other platforms or in-person meetings. While it offers transcription in over 30 languages and works across desktop and mobile Zoom clients, it has limited external integrations. Users on free Zoom accounts have restricted access, and some reviewers note that certain features aren't as robust as dedicated meeting assistant tools.

## Comparing Fathom and Zoom AI

### Fathom
* Fathom works with multiple meeting platforms but lacks a mobile app and in-person recording capabilities. It offers a generous free tier with accurate transcription and AI summaries, though advanced features require paid plans.
* While it integrates with some CRMs and offers workflow automations, Fathom's integration ecosystem remains limited compared to more established tools. Users still need to manually move insights from meetings to their actual workflow systems.

### Zoom AI
* Zoom AI provides built-in meeting intelligence exclusively for Zoom calls with no additional setup required. It's included with paid Zoom plans but offers limited functionality outside the Zoom ecosystem.
* Despite convenient in-platform summarization and action items, Zoom AI's lack of external integrations means users must manually transfer insights to other tools. The system falls short in connecting meeting outcomes to broader work processes.

| Feature | Fathom | Zoom AI |
|---------|--------|---------|
| Platform support | Multiple platforms ✅ | Zoom only ❌ |
| Free plan | Generous tier ✅ | Limited access ❌ |
| In-person meetings | Not supported ❌ | Not supported ❌ |
| External audio | No upload ❌ | No upload ❌ |
| Third-party integrations | Basic options ❌ | Very limited ❌ |
| Automation | Basic workflows ❌ | Limited features ❌ |

| Mobile support | No app ❌ | Available ✅ |

Fathom makes more sense for teams using multiple meeting platforms who need a dedicated note-taking solution. Its free tier allows for experimentation, and paid plans offer more sophisticated summaries and some CRM integrations. However, its desktop-only requirement and limited integration scope make it less practical for mobile workers or those needing deep workflow connections.

Zoom AI fits best for teams already heavily invested in Zoom's ecosystem who want simple meeting intelligence without additional costs or setup. The seamless integration and mobile support make it convenient for existing Zoom users, but the platform lock-in limits its utility for organizations using multiple meeting tools or needing advanced integrations to operationalize meeting outcomes.

## Fathom vs Zoom AI: What do users say?

Fathom and Zoom AI Companion offer contrasting approaches to AI meeting assistance. Fathom, which integrates with Zoom, Google Meet, and Teams, provides real-time transcription in 25+ languages and generates various AI summary formats. Users particularly praise Fathom's generous free plan, accurate transcriptions, and intuitive interface that allows them to be fully present during meetings. Its pricing structure ranges from a free tier with limited AI summaries to premium team plans ($19-29/user/month) with advanced CRM integrations. Some drawbacks include the lack of external audio file support and no mobile app. Meanwhile, Zoom AI Companion is built directly into Zoom's platform for seamless integration. It automatically generates meeting summaries and action items, allows participants to ask questions during meetings, and assists with related communications. Included at no additional cost for paid Zoom subscribers, it's praised for its ease of use and instant summary generation. However, it only works within Zoom's ecosystem, has limited integration capabilities with external tools, and some users find certain features less robust than dedicated tools.
