# Bluedot vs Fathom – Feature and product comparison

Here's what you should look for in an AI meeting automation tool:  
* Transcripts that create a word-for-word record of the meeting. For example, a one-hour product development meeting generates a searchable document containing every feature discussion, technical requirement, and team decision.
* [Action items](/releases/add-action-items-to-meetings) are pulled directly from the conversation. When someone says "John will update the wireframes by Friday," the AI automatically creates a tracked task with the assignee and deadline.
* Meeting summaries distill hour-long conversations into 2-3 paragraphs. A 45-minute sprint planning meeting becomes a concise overview of sprint goals, resource allocation, and key decisions.
* Topic segmentation breaks discussions into labeled sections. A client call covering multiple projects is automatically divided into sections like "Website Redesign," "Q1 Marketing Campaign," and "Budget Review."

## Other key features
In addition to the quality of these deliverables, we'll want to look at a number of other key factors:
* Ease-of-use: does it have a simple, intuitive setup that works for non-technical users?
* In-person meeting support: can it transcribe audio from live recordings or uploaded files, not just virtual calls?
* Security and privacy: how is customer data handled on the platform?
* Integrations: can it connect with your existing stack, like HubSpot, Notion, or Slack?
* Functionality: does it go beyond transcriptions and actually help you take action?
* Languages: can it transcribe and summarize meetings in different languages?
* Desktop and mobile apps: can you access it on Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android for on-the-go meetings?

## Understanding Bluedot and Fathom
Bluedot is an AI meeting recorder that works as a Chrome extension without needing a meeting bot. It records and transcribes meetings on Google Meet, Zoom, Microsoft Teams and other platforms in real-time with support for over 100 languages. The tool generates AI-powered meeting notes that can be synced to other systems like Salesforce, HubSpot, Notion, Slack, and Google Docs through one-click integration.

The service operates with tiered pricing: a free version limited to 5 total meetings, Basic (~$18/month) for unlimited audio-only recordings up to 1 hour each, Pro (~$25/month) with unlimited video recording and meeting length, and Business (~$40/month) with additional CRM integrations and guest access. Bluedot works through a desktop app that records locally, and while it supports in-person meetings through local recording, it currently lacks mobile app support.

Fathom is an AI meeting assistant that works with Zoom, Google Meet, and Teams through a desktop application. It records meetings, provides real-time transcription in over 25 languages, and automatically generates different styles of summaries including bullet points, action items, and chronological overviews. The platform lets users highlight important moments during calls, offers post-meeting content via an AI Q&A feature, and integrates with CRM systems like HubSpot and Salesforce.

The service offers a free plan with unlimited recordings but AI summaries limited to 5 meetings monthly, with paid tiers starting at $15/month for individuals and $19-29/user/month for teams. It works only for scheduled online meetings (not in-person conversations or external audio uploads), requires a desktop application, and doesn't support mobile devices. Users can access different summary formats and share content with team members depending on their subscription level.

## Comparing Bluedot and Fathom

### Bluedot

* Bluedot offers high-accuracy transcription and seamless integration with multiple platforms through a Chrome extension without requiring a meeting bot. Its free plan is limited to just 5 meetings lifetime, making it essentially a trial version. While Bluedot supports 100+ languages and provides extensive integration options with CRMs and project tools, it falls short on the depth of these integrations and doesn't truly help users maximize productivity from their meetings.

### Fathom

* Fathom provides AI meeting notes primarily for Zoom, Google Meet, and Teams, generating multiple summary formats and allowing users to highlight key moments during calls. Its free tier offers unlimited recordings with full AI summaries for 5 meetings monthly, but it lacks support for in-person meetings and external audio uploads. While Fathom connects with various tools like CRMs and project management apps, its integration capabilities remain somewhat superficial, limiting how effectively users can transform meeting insights into actionable workflows.

| Feature | Bluedot | Fathom |
|---------|---------|--------|
| Free Plan | 5 lifetime meetings ❌ | 5 full summaries monthly ✅ |
| In-person Recording | Supported ✅ | Not supported ❌ |
| Language Support | 100+ languages ✅ | 25+ languages ✅ |
| Platform Support | Multiple platforms ✅ | Limited platforms ✅ |
| CRM Integration | Available ✅ | Available ✅ |
| Mobile App | Not available ❌ | Not available ❌ |
| Meeting Bot | Not needed ✅ | Required ❌ |
| Price Range | $14-40/month ❌ | $15-29/month ✅ |

Bluedot might be the better choice for teams requiring high transcription accuracy across various meeting environments, especially those needing in-person meeting support. Its bot-free approach makes it suitable for participants who aren't meeting hosts and need discreet recording capabilities, though the limited free tier makes it primarily an option for businesses with budget for productivity tools.

Fathom would better serve users primarily conducting online meetings on supported platforms who need a more economical solution. Its generous free tier makes it accessible for individuals and small teams, while its straightforward interface and quick summary generation appeal to those who prioritize simplicity over comprehensive feature sets. Both tools, however, would benefit from deeper workflow integrations that help users apply meeting insights more effectively.
