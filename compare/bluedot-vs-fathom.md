# Bluedot vs. Fathom – Which should you choose?  
AI meeting notes platforms provide four primary deliverables:  
  
* Transcripts create a word-for-word record of the meeting. For example, a one-hour product development meeting generates a searchable document containing every feature discussion, technical requirement, and team decision.  
* Action items are pulled directly from the conversation. When someone says "John will update the wireframes by Friday," the AI automatically creates a tracked task with the assignee and deadline.  
* Meeting summaries distill hour-long conversations into 2-3 paragraphs. A 45-minute sprint planning meeting becomes a concise overview of sprint goals, resource allocation, and key decisions.  
* Topic segmentation breaks discussions into labeled sections. A client call covering multiple projects is automatically divided into sections like "Website Redesign," "Q1 Marketing Campaign," and "Budget Review."  
  
In addition to the quality of these deliverables, we'll want to look at a number of other key factors:  
  
* Free trial: can you test it for free before committing?  
* Ease-of-use: does it have a simple, intuitive setup that works for non-technical users?  
* In-person meeting support: can it transcribe audio from live recordings or uploaded files, not just virtual calls?  
* Security and privacy: how is customer data handled on the platform?  
* Integrations: can it connect with your existing stack, like HubSpot, Notion, or Slack?  
* Functionality: does it go beyond transcriptions and actually help you take action?  
* Languages: can it transcribe and summarize meetings in different languages?  
* Desktop and mobile apps: can you access it on Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android for on-the-go meetings?  
* Recordings: is there support for saving and playing back audio and video recordings of meetings?    
## Evaluating Bluedot and Fathom  
### Bluedot
* Bluedot offers accurate transcription without requiring bot invites, works across major meeting platforms, and integrates with popular apps for automatic note syncing. The tool runs in the background and functions even when users aren't meeting hosts.
* The free tier is limited to 5 lifetime meetings, requires Chrome for best performance, and lacks full mobile support. Higher tier plans are needed for advanced features like longer recordings and custom templates, with relatively expensive pricing at Pro/Business levels.

### Fathom
* Fathom provides quick transcription with AI summaries, multiple summary formats, and a simple interface. The free tier is generous compared to competitors, and the tool focuses on live meeting capture and notes.
* The platform requires desktop use with no mobile app, doesn't support external audio file transcription, and reserves some features like meeting templates for paid tiers. Some users report the on-screen widgets can be distracting during calls.  
## Comparison table    
Bluedot works better for teams that meet in person and need local recording, though its limited integrations mean you'll still be doing most of the work manually. The tool handles basic meeting tasks well but doesn't go deep enough to meaningfully improve how teams collaborate or execute on decisions.

Fathom is built for remote-first teams who want their meetings automatically processed in the cloud, even though the automation features aren't comprehensive enough to eliminate manual work. While it offers similar core features to Bluedot, neither tool provides the kind of rich integration ecosystem that would make them truly indispensable for getting work done after the meeting ends.
