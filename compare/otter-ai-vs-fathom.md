# Otter.ai vs. Fathom: Which should you choose?
AI meeting notes platforms provide four primary deliverables:

• Transcripts create a word-for-word record of the meeting. For example, a one-hour product development meeting generates a searchable document containing every feature discussion, technical requirement, and team decision.
• Action items are pulled directly from the conversation. When someone says "John will update the wireframes by Friday," the AI automatically creates a tracked task with the assignee and deadline.
• Meeting summaries distill hour-long conversations into 2-3 paragraphs. A 45-minute sprint planning meeting becomes a concise overview of sprint goals, resource allocation, and key decisions.
• Topic segmentation breaks discussions into labeled sections. A client call covering multiple projects is automatically divided into sections like "Website Redesign," "Q1 Marketing Campaign," and "Budget Review."

In addition to the quality of these deliverables, we'll want to look at a number of other key factors:

• Free trial: can you test it for free before committing?
• Ease-of-use: does it have a simple, intuitive setup that works for non-technical users?
• In-person meeting support: can it transcribe audio from live recordings or uploaded files, not just virtual calls?
• Security and privacy: how is customer data handled on the platform?
• Integrations: can it connect with your existing stack, like HubSpot, Notion, or Slack?
• Functionality: does it go beyond transcriptions and actually help you take action?
• Languages: can it transcribe and summarize meetings in different languages?
• Desktop and mobile apps: can you access it on Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android for on-the-go meeitngs?
• Recordings: is there support for saving and playing back audio and video recordings of meetings?
## Evaluating Otter.ai and Fathom
Otter.ai: Users appreciate its easy-to-use interface, live editing of transcripts, and strong free plan with generous transcription limits. However, some users note transcription errors with accents or fast speech, language limitations to English only, and hit-or-miss speaker ID functionality.

Fathom: Users praise its top-notch accuracy in transcripts, quick high-quality summaries, and free unlimited usage for core features. However, some users mention historical Zoom-only support, potential duplicate note issues with simultaneous use, and a focus on post-meeting output rather than real-time collaboration.

Otter.ai might appeal to individuals or companies looking for a free and easy-to-use tool with Zoom and calendar integration, but may fall short for those needing deeper integrations with platforms like HubSpot or Notion, or for tasks beyond basic meeting transcriptions. Fathom, on the other hand, could be attractive to users seeking a very easy-to-use tool with multi-language support and mobile apps, but may lack in-depth integrations and features to truly enhance meeting productivity.

Both Otter.ai and Fathom offer free plans and basic functionalities like Zoom integration, but their limitations in integrations and automation engines may hinder users looking to streamline their meeting workflows effectively. While Otter.ai supports multiple languages and Fathom boasts user-friendly interfaces, users may find themselves needing more robust tools to truly maximize the efficiency and productivity of their meetings.
