# Otter.ai vs. Fathom – Which should you choose?  
AI meeting notes platforms provide four primary deliverables:  
  
* Transcripts create a word-for-word record of the meeting. For example, a one-hour product development meeting generates a searchable document containing every feature discussion, technical requirement, and team decision.  
* Action items are pulled directly from the conversation. When someone says "John will update the wireframes by Friday," the AI automatically creates a tracked task with the assignee and deadline.  
* Meeting summaries distill hour-long conversations into 2-3 paragraphs. A 45-minute sprint planning meeting becomes a concise overview of sprint goals, resource allocation, and key decisions.  
* Topic segmentation breaks discussions into labeled sections. A client call covering multiple projects is automatically divided into sections like "Website Redesign," "Q1 Marketing Campaign," and "Budget Review."  
  
In addition to the quality of these deliverables, we'll want to look at a number of other key factors:  
  
* Free trial: can you test it for free before committing?  
* Ease-of-use: does it have a simple, intuitive setup that works for non-technical users?  
* In-person meeting support: can it transcribe audio from live recordings or uploaded files, not just virtual calls?  
* Security and privacy: how is customer data handled on the platform?  
* Integrations: can it connect with your existing stack, like HubSpot, Notion, or Slack?  
* Functionality: does it go beyond transcriptions and actually help you take action?  
* Languages: can it transcribe and summarize meetings in different languages?  
* Desktop and mobile apps: can you access it on Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android for on-the-go meetings?  
* Recordings: is there support for saving and playing back audio and video recordings of meetings?    
## Evaluating Otter.ai and Fathom  
### Otter.ai
* Otter offers live transcript editing, Zoom integration, calendar sync, and auto-recording with a free tier that includes substantial transcription time. Interface allows direct editing of transcripts and automated meeting recording, though accuracy drops with accents and rapid speech, and the platform only works in English.
* The system handles speaker identification but requires manual corrections, particularly in multi-person conversations. Free plan includes core functionality for basic transcription and meeting recording needs, with paid tiers for additional features.

### Fathom
* Fathom provides transcription across multiple languages, with particular strength in non-English content, and generates meeting summaries that include decisions and key points. The platform offers unlimited usage of basic features at no cost, including core transcription and summary capabilities.
* Platform integration focuses primarily on Zoom, with other meeting platforms in beta testing. System has limitations with simultaneous multi-user access and real-time collaboration, and requires paid plans for advanced analytics and custom integrations.  
## Comparison table    
Otter.ai works well for small teams and freelancers who just need basic English transcription and meeting notes, with its simple interface and free plan being the main draws. The platform is straightforward but lacks deeper integrations and automation features that could make it more useful for actual productivity.

Fathom is better suited for international companies or larger teams that need support for multiple languages and want some basic tool integrations like HubSpot. While it offers more features than Otter, it still falls short on meaningful automation and lacks the comprehensive integration ecosystem that would make it truly valuable for getting work done after meetings.
