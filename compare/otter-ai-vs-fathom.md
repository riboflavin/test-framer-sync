# Otter.ai vs. Fathom – Which should you choose?  
AI meeting notes platforms provide four primary deliverables:  
  
* Transcripts create a word-for-word record of the meeting. For example, a one-hour product development meeting generates a searchable document containing every feature discussion, technical requirement, and team decision.  
* Action items are pulled directly from the conversation. When someone says "John will update the wireframes by Friday," the AI automatically creates a tracked task with the assignee and deadline.  
* Meeting summaries distill hour-long conversations into 2-3 paragraphs. A 45-minute sprint planning meeting becomes a concise overview of sprint goals, resource allocation, and key decisions.  
* Topic segmentation breaks discussions into labeled sections. A client call covering multiple projects is automatically divided into sections like "Website Redesign," "Q1 Marketing Campaign," and "Budget Review."  
  
In addition to the quality of these deliverables, we'll want to look at a number of other key factors:  
  
* Free trial: can you test it for free before committing?  
* Ease-of-use: does it have a simple, intuitive setup that works for non-technical users?  
* In-person meeting support: can it transcribe audio from live recordings or uploaded files, not just virtual calls?  
* Security and privacy: how is customer data handled on the platform?  
* Integrations: can it connect with your existing stack, like HubSpot, Notion, or Slack?  
* Functionality: does it go beyond transcriptions and actually help you take action?  
* Languages: can it transcribe and summarize meetings in different languages?  
* Desktop and mobile apps: can you access it on Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android for on-the-go meetings?  
* Recordings: is there support for saving and playing back audio and video recordings of meetings?    
## Evaluating Otter.ai and Fathom  
### Otter.ai
- Easy to use; intuitive interface and live editing of transcripts.
- Strong free plan with generous transcription limits.
- Seamless integration with Zoom & calendar for auto-recording meetings.
- Transcription errors with accents or fast speech (not as accurate as human).
- Only supports English, which is limiting.
- Speaker ID can be hit-or-miss, requiring manual fixes in notes.

### Fathom
- Top-notch accuracy in transcripts, even with multiple speakers.
- Quick, high-quality summaries that capture key points and decisions.
- Free unlimited usage for core features (rare in this space).
- Supports many languages (users report better results for non-English than competitors).
- Historically Zoom-only (new support for other platforms is recent and in beta).
- Some duplicate note issues if multiple team members use it simultaneously on a call.

Both Otter.ai and Fathom offer free plans with Zoom and calendar integration, making them suitable for individuals or small companies looking for basic meeting transcription and analytics. However, both tools lack deep integrations with popular platforms like HubSpot and Notion, limiting their usefulness for users who heavily rely on these tools for their workflow.

While Otter.ai and Fathom are user-friendly and support mobile apps, they fall short in providing comprehensive solutions for in-person meetings and local recording needs. Additionally, the lack of an automation engine in both tools may hinder users who require more advanced features to streamline their meeting processes effectively.
