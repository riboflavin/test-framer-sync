# Notion Meeting Recorder vs Fireflies.ai for meeting automation

## Notion Meeting Recorder

Notion Meeting Recorder captures meetings by recording audio directly through your device rather than using a meeting bot. It transcribes conversations and generates summaries with key points and action items in a Notion page. The tool works for both virtual and in-person meetings and can be activated via a /meet command or through Notion calendar. All content stays within Notion, making it searchable and connectable to other workspace elements like tasks or projects.

The feature is part of the Notion AI add-on ($10/user/month or $8/user/month annually) and works across 16 languages. It functions on desktop (Mac/Windows) and mobile apps, making it accessible for various meeting contexts. While it captures audio locally from your device for any meeting platform, the tool is primarily designed for teams already embedded in the Notion ecosystem rather than as a standalone solution.

Fireflies.ai is an AI meeting assistant that joins calls as a participant to record, transcribe, and summarize discussions across platforms including Zoom, Teams, Google Meet, and Webex. The system, nicknamed "Fred," provides searchable transcripts with speaker labels, generates summaries and action items, and offers an AskFred chatbot for querying meeting content afterward. It supports in-person meetings via a mobile app, allows local recording through its app, and can process offline file uploads for transcription.

The service operates on a tiered pricing model with a free plan offering limited credits, a Pro plan (~$10/user/month) for unlimited audio recording, and a Business plan (~$19/user/month) adding video recording and analytics. Fireflies transcribes over 100 languages and integrates with numerous tools including HubSpot, Salesforce, Slack, and Asana for automated note transfer. While it lacks a dedicated desktop application, it functions through a web app and Chrome extension, with mobile apps available for iOS and Android.

## Comparing Notion Meeting Recorder and Fireflies.ai

### Notion Meeting Recorder

* Notion Meeting Recorder works within your existing Notion workspace, recording and transcribing meetings while generating summaries and action items that become part of your knowledge base. The tool relies on your device's audio input rather than joining as a meeting participant, limiting its capabilities when audio quality is poor.
* While the recorder integrates seamlessly with Notion's ecosystem of databases and pages, it remains isolated from external productivity tools that teams might use outside the Notion environment. The $10/month add-on fee on top of existing Notion plans creates an additional cost barrier for teams seeking comprehensive meeting solutions.

### Fireflies.ai

* Fireflies.ai operates as a standalone service that joins virtual meetings as a participant to record, transcribe and summarize conversations across platforms like Zoom and Teams. The tool offers broad integration capabilities with CRMs and project management software, but falls short of providing deep workflow automation beyond basic note-logging.
* With pricing tiers including a free option, Fireflies makes meeting intelligence accessible, yet gates more advanced features behind higher payment tiers. The platform's transcription quality varies with accents and technical terminology, limiting its effectiveness for specialized teams or international organizations.

Notion Meeting Recorder fits best for teams already committed to the Notion ecosystem who want seamless integration with their existing workflows and databases. These users benefit from having meeting content directly embedded in their project documentation, though they may find themselves limited when attempting to share or act on meeting data outside Notion's boundaries.

Fireflies.ai serves teams using multiple platforms who need a tool that works across their tech stack without commitment to any single ecosystem. While it offers broader integration options than Notion, users still must manually connect insights to action, as neither tool provides the deep workflow automation needed to truly transform meeting content into meaningful progress.

## Notion Meeting Recorder vs Fireflies.ai: What do users say?

Notion Meeting Recorder and Fireflies.ai are both AI-powered meeting transcription tools with distinct approaches. Notion Meeting Recorder integrates directly into the Notion ecosystem, allowing users to capture and transcribe meetings within their existing workspace. Users appreciate how the recorder saves time by generating swift summaries and action items, keeping everything connected in one place without context switching. The integrated approach works well for teams already committed to Notion, though some reviewers note it requires full Notion adoption to maximize benefits. Notion's pricing includes a $10/month AI add-on that enables the meeting notes feature.

Fireflies.ai takes a different approach as a cloud-based meeting assistant that joins calls directly as a participant. Users praise its ease of setup, accuracy (reportedly over 95% in transcription quality), and ability to work across multiple platforms including Zoom, Teams, and Google Meet. It offers robust integrations with tools like Slack, Asana, and various CRMs. While many appreciate its free tier, some reviewers mention that summaries can sometimes be too high-level and transcription accuracy may decrease with heavy accents or technical jargon.

Both tools support in-person meetings and offer mobile apps, though Fireflies has more extensive language support (100+ languages versus Notion's 16). Fireflies operates primarily as a web tool while Notion provides dedicated desktop applications.
