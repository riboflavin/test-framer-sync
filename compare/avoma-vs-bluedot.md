# Avoma vs Bluedot for meeting automation

Avoma is an AI meeting assistant that records, transcribes, and summarizes meetings. It generates notes organized by topics like pain points and next steps, with around 95% transcription accuracy even with jargon or accents. The platform supports agenda templates, live note collaboration, CRM synchronization, and works with multiple meeting platforms. While primarily used by sales and customer success teams for call logging and follow-ups, it's also used for general meeting productivity across organizations.

The platform offers tiered pricing from a free plan (limited to about 10 meetings monthly) to enterprise solutions at $129/user. It integrates with calendars, CRMs, and other tools through its ecosystem, while supporting 20+ languages for transcription. Avoma provides mobile apps for iOS and Android that can record offline meetings, but has no dedicated desktop application. Some users find it unnecessarily complex for basic transcription needs, and occasionally experience minor bugs like delayed bot joining or speaker identification errors.

Bluedot is an AI meeting recorder and note-taker that works through a Chrome extension without requiring a meeting bot. It records and transcribes meetings in real-time across platforms like Google Meet, Zoom, and Microsoft Teams, supporting over 100 languages. The tool generates AI-powered meeting notes and offers one-click sync to various systems including CRM platforms, project tools, Google Docs, and Slack. It operates discreetly in the background, allowing users to capture meetings even when they aren't the host.

The service offers tiered pricing with a limited free version (5 meetings total), then paid plans starting at $18/user/month for audio recordings and increasing to $40/user/month for business features including unlimited video recordings, CRM integrations, and topic tracking. Bluedot works well for in-person meetings via local recording, but currently lacks mobile app support, focusing instead on desktop functionality through its Chrome extension and desktop application for Windows and Mac.

## Comparing Avoma and Bluedot

### Avoma
* Avoma functions as an AI meeting assistant that records, transcribes, and generates structured notes with topic breakdowns and action items. It offers agenda templates and CRM syncing capabilities but lacks depth in streamlining post-meeting workflows and turning insights into concrete actions.
* The tool provides a free plan with limited functionality and paid tiers ranging from $19-$129 per user monthly, which some users find expensive for small teams. While it achieves approximately 95% transcription accuracy and integrates with several platforms, its hefty platform can be overkill for simple needs and occasionally experiences delays in joining meetings.

### Bluedot
* Bluedot operates as a Chrome extension-based meeting recorder that works without adding a bot to calls, capturing and transcribing meetings from major platforms with support for over 100 languages. Though it provides one-click syncing to various systems, its integration capabilities fall short when users need to apply meeting content in practical workflows.
* The tool offers only 5 free meetings total before requiring payment, with plans ranging from $14-$40 per user monthly when billed annually. While users praise its transcription accuracy and discreet background recording, it has limited mobile support and requires Chrome for optimal performance, which restricts its flexibility across environments.

Avoma is better suited for sales and customer success teams who need a comprehensive platform with mobile capabilities and ongoing free access. Its CRM integration and templating features make it valuable for organizations tracking customer interactions, though users should be prepared for a more complex tool that may require adjustment time.

Bluedot works best for individual professionals and teams who prioritize transcription accuracy and discreet recording without meeting interruptions. The Chrome extension approach makes it ideal for users who don't have meeting hosting privileges but still need to capture content, though the limited free tier means users should be ready to commit financially after testing.

## Avoma vs Bluedot: What do users say?

Avoma user reviews highlight it as an all-in-one AI meeting assistant with exceptional transcription accuracy (~95%), even handling jargon and accents well. Users particularly appreciate how it saves time on administrative tasks, allowing them to focus on conversations instead of note-taking. The platform offers strong integration capabilities with tools like Zoom, HubSpot, and Slack, and responsive customer support receives positive mentions. However, some users find it might be overkill for simple needs, occasionally experience minor bugs or delays with the meeting bot, and note that the detailed transcripts can be dense to skim. While the free plan makes it accessible to try, pricing for higher tiers is considered premium.

Bluedot stands out in reviews for its exceptional transcription accuracy, with many users calling it "the most accurate" AI note-taker they've tried. Its Chrome extension approach means no bot needs to join meetings, providing discreet background recording that works even when you're not the host. Users praise its seamless integration with popular apps like Salesforce, HubSpot, Notion, and Slack, automatically updating meeting notes and saving manual effort. The main criticisms focus on the extremely limited free version (only 5 meetings lifetime), Chrome dependency for the best experience, and relatively steep pricing at higher tiers compared to competitors.
