# Bluedot vs Zoom AI for meeting automation

Bluedot is an AI meeting recorder and transcription tool delivered via Chrome extension that works across Google Meet, Zoom, Microsoft Teams and other platforms without requiring a meeting bot. It records and transcribes meetings in real-time across 100+ languages, then generates AI meeting notes that can be synchronized to various systems including CRMs (Salesforce, HubSpot), productivity tools (Notion, Slack), and Google Docs. The tool functions discreetly in the background even when you're not the meeting host.

The service operates on a tiered pricing model starting with a limited free version (5 meetings total) before requiring payment. Paid plans range from Basic ($18/month) offering audio-only recording with 1-hour limits, to Pro ($25/month) with unlimited video recording and custom templates, to Business ($40/month) with additional CRM integrations and unlimited guest access. While it works across major meeting platforms through its Chrome extension and desktop apps, it currently lacks mobile support and requires Chrome for optimal functionality.

Zoom AI is a built-in feature for paid Zoom subscribers that generates meeting summaries and action items automatically after calls. It offers real-time functionality during meetings, allowing participants to ask questions like "What did I miss?" and get immediate answers, while also helping with composing emails and creating documents related to meeting content.

The tool works exclusively within Zoom's platform and doesn't support meetings on other services or in-person gatherings. While it offers live transcription in over 30 languages and functions on both desktop and mobile Zoom apps, its integration capabilities are limited to Zoom's ecosystem with minimal external workflow automation. The functionality comes at no additional cost for users with paid Zoom subscriptions.

## Comparing Bluedot and Zoom AI

### Bluedot

* Bluedot offers transcription across multiple meeting platforms with broad language support, but maintains minimal integration depth beyond basic data syncing. Its Chrome extension approach enables recording without intrusive bots, yet the tool does little to actively facilitate meeting outcomes and has a steep price after a limited free tier.

### Zoom AI

* Zoom AI provides native summaries and action items within the Zoom ecosystem, making it simple for existing paid Zoom users. However, its platform-specific nature limits use to Zoom meetings only, and the AI lacks meaningful integrations with external tools needed to fully automate post-meeting workflows.

| Feature | Bluedot | Zoom AI |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Cross-platform | ✅ | ❌ |
| In-person support | ✅ | ❌ |
| Local recording | ✅ | ⚠️ |
| Integration depth | ⚠️ | ❌ |
| Workflow automation | ⚠️ | ❌ |
| Language support | ✅ | ✅ |
| Desktop app | ✅ | ✅ |
| Mobile support | ❌ | ✅ |
| Free tier | ❌ | ✅ |

Bluedot makes sense for teams working across multiple meeting platforms who need accurate transcription and basic integrations with systems like Salesforce or Notion. Its platform-agnostic nature suits organizations with mixed technology stacks, but the cost is hard to justify for smaller teams or those wanting true workflow automation beyond simple note syncing.

Zoom AI fits organizations already standardized on Zoom who want simple summaries without additional costs. It's the economical choice for teams exclusively using Zoom, though its value diminishes for organizations needing cross-platform support or deeper integrations with project management and CRM tools to meaningfully advance their work.

## Bluedot vs Zoom AI: What do users say?

Bluedot is an AI meeting recorder and note-taker available as a Chrome extension that works across Google Meet, Zoom, Microsoft Teams, and other platforms without requiring a meeting bot. Users consistently praise its transcription accuracy, with many claiming it's "the most accurate" AI notetaker they've tried. The tool's discreet background recording is appreciated since no bot needs to be invited, allowing it to work even when users aren't meeting hosts. Bluedot offers strong integration capabilities with popular apps like Slack, Notion, Google Drive, HubSpot, and Salesforce, automatically updating meeting notes. However, the free version is extremely limited with only 5 lifetime meetings, and paid plans range from $18/month for the Basic tier to $40/month for Business features. While it supports 100+ transcription languages and offers desktop apps, there's currently no mobile app support.

Zoom AI, on the other hand, provides built-in AI features for Zoom's platform, generating meeting summaries and action items at the end of calls. Users can ask the AI questions during meetings like "What did I miss?" and receive immediate answers. The seamless integration within the Zoom ecosystem means no additional setup is required if you're already using Zoom. Summaries and action items are generated almost instantly after meetings conclude. While it's included at no extra cost for paid Zoom subscribers, it doesn't work for meetings on other platforms, and free Zoom users are constrained by the 40-minute meeting limit. Some users find certain features less robust than dedicated tools, with limited control over which meetings to record or summarize, and occasional difficulties sharing AI notes outside of Zoom.
