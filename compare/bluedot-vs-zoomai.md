# Bluedot vs Zoom AI – Feature and product comparison

AI meeting notes platforms provide four primary deliverables:
* Transcripts that create a word-for-word record of the meeting. For example, a one-hour product development meeting generates a searchable document containing every feature discussion, technical requirement, and team decision.
* Action items are pulled directly from the conversation. When someone says "John will update the wireframes by Friday," the AI automatically creates a tracked task with the assignee and deadline.
* Meeting summaries distill hour-long conversations into 2-3 paragraphs. A 45-minute sprint planning meeting becomes a concise overview of sprint goals, resource allocation, and key decisions.
* Topic segmentation breaks discussions into labeled sections. A client call covering multiple projects is automatically divided into sections like "Website Redesign," "Q1 Marketing Campaign," and "Budget Review."

In addition to the quality of these deliverables, we'll want to look at a number of other key factors:
* Ease-of-use: does it have a simple, intuitive setup that works for non-technical users?
* In-person meeting support: can it transcribe audio from live recordings or uploaded files, not just virtual calls?
* Security and privacy: how is customer data handled on the platform?
* Integrations: can it connect with your existing stack, like HubSpot, Notion, or Slack?
* Functionality: does it go beyond transcriptions and actually help you take action?
* Languages: can it transcribe and summarize meetings in different languages?
* Desktop and mobile apps: can you access it on Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android for on-the-go meetings?

## About Bluedot
Bluedot is an AI meeting recorder and transcription tool delivered via Chrome extension that works across Google Meet, Zoom, Microsoft Teams and other platforms without requiring a meeting bot. It records and transcribes meetings in real-time across 100+ languages, then generates AI meeting notes that can be synchronized to various systems including CRMs (Salesforce, HubSpot), productivity tools (Notion, Slack), and Google Docs. The tool functions discreetly in the background even when you're not the meeting host.

The service operates on a tiered pricing model starting with a limited free version (5 meetings total) before requiring payment. Paid plans range from Basic ($18/month) offering audio-only recording with 1-hour limits, to Pro ($25/month) with unlimited video recording and custom templates, to Business ($40/month) with additional CRM integrations and unlimited guest access. While it works across major meeting platforms through its Chrome extension and desktop apps, it currently lacks mobile support and requires Chrome for optimal functionality.

## About Zoom AI
Zoom AI is a built-in feature for paid Zoom subscribers that generates meeting summaries and action items automatically after calls. It offers real-time functionality during meetings, allowing participants to ask questions like "What did I miss?" and get immediate answers, while also helping with composing emails and creating documents related to meeting content.

The tool works exclusively within Zoom's platform and doesn't support meetings on other services or in-person gatherings. While it offers live transcription in over 30 languages and functions on both desktop and mobile Zoom apps, its integration capabilities are limited to Zoom's ecosystem with minimal external workflow automation. The functionality comes at no additional cost for users with paid Zoom subscriptions.

## Comparison
### Bluedot

* Bluedot offers transcription across multiple meeting platforms with broad language support, but maintains minimal integration depth beyond basic data syncing. Its Chrome extension approach enables recording without intrusive bots, yet the tool does little to actively facilitate meeting outcomes and has a steep price after a limited free tier.

### Zoom AI

* Zoom AI provides native summaries and action items within the Zoom ecosystem, making it simple for existing paid Zoom users. However, its platform-specific nature limits use to Zoom meetings only, and the AI lacks meaningful integrations with external tools needed to fully automate post-meeting workflows.

| Feature | Bluedot | Zoom AI |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Cross-platform | ✅ | ❌ |
| In-person support | ✅ | ❌ |
| Local recording | ✅ | ⚠️ |
| Integration depth | ⚠️ | ❌ |
| Workflow automation | ⚠️ | ❌ |
| Language support | ✅ | ✅ |
| Desktop app | ✅ | ✅ |
| Mobile support | ❌ | ✅ |
| Free tier | ❌ | ✅ |

Bluedot makes sense for teams working across multiple meeting platforms who need accurate transcription and basic integrations with systems like Salesforce or Notion. Its platform-agnostic nature suits organizations with mixed technology stacks, but the cost is hard to justify for smaller teams or those wanting true workflow automation beyond simple note syncing.

Zoom AI fits organizations already standardized on Zoom who want simple summaries without additional costs. It's the economical choice for teams exclusively using Zoom, though its value diminishes for organizations needing cross-platform support or deeper integrations with project management and CRM tools to meaningfully advance their work.
