# tldv vs Otter.ai – Feature and product comparison

Here's what you should look for in an AI meeting automation tool:  
* Transcripts that create a word-for-word record of the meeting. For example, a one-hour product development meeting generates a searchable document containing every feature discussion, technical requirement, and team decision.
* [Action items](/releases/add-action-items-to-meetings) are pulled directly from the conversation. When someone says "John will update the wireframes by Friday," the AI automatically creates a tracked task with the assignee and deadline.
* Meeting summaries distill hour-long conversations into 2-3 paragraphs. A 45-minute sprint planning meeting becomes a concise overview of sprint goals, resource allocation, and key decisions.
* Topic segmentation breaks discussions into labeled sections. A client call covering multiple projects is automatically divided into sections like "Website Redesign," "Q1 Marketing Campaign," and "Budget Review."

## Other key features
In addition to the quality of these deliverables, we'll want to look at a number of other key factors:
* Ease-of-use: does it have a simple, intuitive setup that works for non-technical users?
* In-person meeting support: can it transcribe audio from live recordings or uploaded files, not just virtual calls?
* Security and privacy: how is customer data handled on the platform?
* Integrations: can it connect with your existing stack, like HubSpot, Notion, or Slack?
* Functionality: does it go beyond transcriptions and actually help you take action?
* Languages: can it transcribe and summarize meetings in different languages?
* Desktop and mobile apps: can you access it on Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android for on-the-go meetings?

## Understanding tldv and Otter.ai
Tldv is a meeting intelligence tool that records, transcribes, and summarizes conversations. It supports over 30 languages and offers timestamped highlights, CRM integration, and AI agents that handle recording, note-taking, and CRM logging. The platform works through a desktop app for Windows and macOS that integrates with Zoom and Microsoft Teams, plus connects with HubSpot, Notion, Salesforce, and thousands of other services.

The service follows a tiered pricing model with a free plan, Pro tier at $18 monthly, and Business tier at $59 monthly. Tldv doesn't support in-person meetings but does offer local recording capabilities through its desktop application. The platform lacks a native mobile app and requires internet connectivity, which can affect performance. Some users have expressed privacy concerns about the service.

Otter.ai is an AI note-taking tool that provides live transcription during meetings via audio recording or by joining virtual meetings through integrations with Zoom and Teams. It automatically generates summaries and highlights from transcripts, identifies speakers, and captures screen content. The system works for both virtual and in-person conversations, with transcripts being searchable and shareable.

The service offers a free plan with 600 minutes of transcription monthly, with paid tiers starting around $10/month for increased minutes and features. Otter includes an automation engine called OtterPilot that generates summaries and can update CRMs. It supports primarily English with some Spanish and French capabilities, operates through web browsers (no desktop app), and offers mobile apps for iOS and Android.

## Comparing tldv and Otter.ai

### tldv

* Tldv offers AI-powered meeting transcription with CRM integrations and AI agents, but lacks robust cross-platform support and is highly dependent on internet quality. Its feature set includes recording, timestamping, and multiple language support, yet users may encounter privacy concerns and limited practical workflow integration.

### Otter.ai

* Otter.ai provides live transcription and AI note-taking with strong in-person capabilities and mobile support, but struggles with transcript verbosity and structure issues. While it offers automatic summaries and speaker identification, its limited language support and integration depth constrain its utility for transforming meeting content into actionable workflows.

| Feature | tldv | Otter.ai |
|---------|------|----------|
| Pricing | $0-$59/mo | $0-$20/mo |
| In-person meetings | ❌ | ✅ |
| Local recording | ✅ | ✅ |
| Language support | 30+ languages | 3 languages |
| Desktop app | ✅ | ❌ |
| Mobile app | ❌ | ✅ |
| Integration depth | Limited | Limited |

Tldv works best for teams already embedded in CRM workflows who primarily conduct remote meetings and need multi-language support. Its desktop-first approach and extensive language options make it suitable for international businesses, though its higher price point and lack of mobile support limit its appeal for on-the-go professionals or teams with in-person interactions.

Otter.ai offers better value for individuals, students, journalists, and teams that frequently conduct in-person meetings or need mobile functionality. Its lower price point and ability to capture live conversations make it more versatile for varied environments, but organizations requiring extensive language support or deep workflow integrations will find its capabilities insufficient for comprehensive meeting management.
