# Krisp vs. Zoom AI: Which should you choose?
AI meeting notes platforms provide four primary deliverables:

• Transcripts create a word-for-word record of the meeting. For example, a one-hour product development meeting generates a searchable document containing every feature discussion, technical requirement, and team decision.
• Action items are pulled directly from the conversation. When someone says "John will update the wireframes by Friday," the AI automatically creates a tracked task with the assignee and deadline.
• Meeting summaries distill hour-long conversations into 2-3 paragraphs. A 45-minute sprint planning meeting becomes a concise overview of sprint goals, resource allocation, and key decisions.
• Topic segmentation breaks discussions into labeled sections. A client call covering multiple projects is automatically divided into sections like "Website Redesign," "Q1 Marketing Campaign," and "Budget Review."

In addition to the quality of these deliverables, we'll want to look at a number of other key factors:

• Free trial: can you test it for free before committing?
• Ease-of-use: does it have a simple, intuitive setup that works for non-technical users?
• In-person meeting support: can it transcribe audio from live recordings or uploaded files, not just virtual calls?
• Security and privacy: how is customer data handled on the platform?
• Integrations: can it connect with your existing stack, like HubSpot, Notion, or Slack?
• Functionality: does it go beyond transcriptions and actually help you take action?
• Languages: can it transcribe and summarize meetings in different languages?
• Desktop and mobile apps: can you access it on Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android for on-the-go meeitngs?
• Recordings: is there support for saving and playing back audio and video recordings of meetings?
## Evaluating Krisp and Zoom AI

Can tax system resources during long meetings.

Zoom AI: Pros - Native integration with Zoom, outputs in Zoom Chat. Real-time Q&A and assistance, whiteboard AI for diagrams. Included with paid Zoom subscription. Cons - Zoom-only, doesn't work with other platforms. No free access, requires paid Zoom plan. Speaker ID limits to logged-in users. No custom vocabulary for industry terms.

Krisp would be suitable for individuals or small businesses looking for a free and easy-to-use tool for virtual meetings, especially if they prioritize in-person meetings and local recording. However, it lacks integrations with popular platforms like HubSpot and Notion, limiting its usefulness for those who rely on such tools for productivity.

Zoom AI, on the other hand, would appeal to Zoom users who value seamless integration with their calendar and prioritize language support, as it offers multiple languages. Nevertheless, both tools fall short in terms of depth of integrations and automation capabilities, which may hinder users in effectively managing and maximizing the outcomes of their meetings.
