# Krisp vs. Zoom AI – Which should you choose?  
AI meeting notes platforms provide four primary deliverables:  
  
* Transcripts create a word-for-word record of the meeting. For example, a one-hour product development meeting generates a searchable document containing every feature discussion, technical requirement, and team decision.  
* Action items are pulled directly from the conversation. When someone says "John will update the wireframes by Friday," the AI automatically creates a tracked task with the assignee and deadline.  
* Meeting summaries distill hour-long conversations into 2-3 paragraphs. A 45-minute sprint planning meeting becomes a concise overview of sprint goals, resource allocation, and key decisions.  
* Topic segmentation breaks discussions into labeled sections. A client call covering multiple projects is automatically divided into sections like "Website Redesign," "Q1 Marketing Campaign," and "Budget Review."  
  
In addition to the quality of these deliverables, we'll want to look at a number of other key factors:  
  
* Free trial: can you test it for free before committing?  
* Ease-of-use: does it have a simple, intuitive setup that works for non-technical users?  
* In-person meeting support: can it transcribe audio from live recordings or uploaded files, not just virtual calls?  
* Security and privacy: how is customer data handled on the platform?  
* Integrations: can it connect with your existing stack, like HubSpot, Notion, or Slack?  
* Functionality: does it go beyond transcriptions and actually help you take action?  
* Languages: can it transcribe and summarize meetings in different languages?  
* Desktop and mobile apps: can you access it on Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android for on-the-go meetings?  
* Recordings: is there support for saving and playing back audio and video recordings of meetings?    
## Evaluating Krisp and Zoom AI  
### Krisp
- Excellent noise cancellation for both microphone and speaker audio.
- Platform-agnostic – use with any meeting software, even phone calls.
- Unlimited transcription on all plans (no minute caps).
- Generous free plan (includes noise reduction and a couple summaries/day).

### Zoom AI
- Native integration – no setup if you use Zoom, and outputs appear right in Zoom Chat.
- Real-time Q&A and assistance during meetings (ask the AI on the fly).
- Unique whiteboard AI for creating mind-maps/diagrams in meeting.
- Included with paid Zoom (no extra fee for existing Zoom subscribers).  
## Comparison table    
Some individuals or organizations may find Krisp appealing for its free plan and ease of use, particularly those who prioritize simplicity and cost-efficiency. However, both tools lack deep integrations with popular platforms like HubSpot and Notion, limiting their utility in streamlining meeting workflows effectively.

On the other hand, Zoom AI's native integration with Zoom and calendars could be attractive to users heavily reliant on these tools for scheduling and hosting meetings. Nevertheless, the tool's lack of support for in-person meetings and local recording may deter those seeking comprehensive solutions for their meeting needs.
