# Krisp vs. Zoom AI – Which should you choose?  
AI meeting notes platforms provide four primary deliverables:  
  
* Transcripts create a word-for-word record of the meeting. For example, a one-hour product development meeting generates a searchable document containing every feature discussion, technical requirement, and team decision.  
* Action items are pulled directly from the conversation. When someone says "John will update the wireframes by Friday," the AI automatically creates a tracked task with the assignee and deadline.  
* Meeting summaries distill hour-long conversations into 2-3 paragraphs. A 45-minute sprint planning meeting becomes a concise overview of sprint goals, resource allocation, and key decisions.  
* Topic segmentation breaks discussions into labeled sections. A client call covering multiple projects is automatically divided into sections like "Website Redesign," "Q1 Marketing Campaign," and "Budget Review."  
  
In addition to the quality of these deliverables, we'll want to look at a number of other key factors:  
  
* Free trial: can you test it for free before committing?  
* Ease-of-use: does it have a simple, intuitive setup that works for non-technical users?  
* In-person meeting support: can it transcribe audio from live recordings or uploaded files, not just virtual calls?  
* Security and privacy: how is customer data handled on the platform?  
* Integrations: can it connect with your existing stack, like HubSpot, Notion, or Slack?  
* Functionality: does it go beyond transcriptions and actually help you take action?  
* Languages: can it transcribe and summarize meetings in different languages?  
* Desktop and mobile apps: can you access it on Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android for on-the-go meetings?  
* Recordings: is there support for saving and playing back audio and video recordings of meetings?    
## Evaluating Krisp and Zoom AI  
### Krisp
* Krisp combines noise cancellation with AI note-taking, offering 60 minutes of free noise removal daily and generating meeting summaries with action items. The software experiences occasional audio distortion, can be CPU-intensive, and some users find the Pro version pricing high, while customer support response times vary.

### Zoom AI
* Zoom AI provides automatic meeting summaries and action items within the Zoom platform at no extra cost for paid accounts, with instant post-meeting recap generation. The tool only works within Zoom meetings, has basic chat integration, and some users report difficulties accessing AI notes outside the platform, while free users face the standard 40-minute meeting limit.  
## Comparison table    
Small teams and startups who need to record both in-person and remote meetings would find Krisp more useful, since it works in both contexts and offers a free tier to get started. The local recording and broader set of integrations make it a practical choice for teams that want to keep things simple and maintain control of their data.

Large companies already using Zoom might prefer to stick with Zoom AI, especially if they need mobile access and don't mind the limited automation features. While both tools offer basic meeting assistance, neither one provides the deep workflow integration or meaningful automation that would actually save significant time for busy teams.
