# Krisp vs. Zoom AI: Which should you choose?
AI meeting notes platforms provide four primary deliverables:  
  
* Transcripts create a word-for-word record of the meeting. For example, a one-hour product development meeting generates a searchable document containing every feature discussion, technical requirement, and team decision.  
* Action items are pulled directly from the conversation. When someone says "John will update the wireframes by Friday," the AI automatically creates a tracked task with the assignee and deadline.  
* Meeting summaries distill hour-long conversations into 2-3 paragraphs. A 45-minute sprint planning meeting becomes a concise overview of sprint goals, resource allocation, and key decisions.  
* Topic segmentation breaks discussions into labeled sections. A client call covering multiple projects is automatically divided into sections like "Website Redesign," "Q1 Marketing Campaign," and "Budget Review."  
  
In addition to the quality of these deliverables, we'll want to look at a number of other key factors:  
  
* Free trial: can you test it for free before committing?  
* Ease-of-use: does it have a simple, intuitive setup that works for non-technical users?  
* In-person meeting support: can it transcribe audio from live recordings or uploaded files, not just virtual calls?  
* Security and privacy: how is customer data handled on the platform?  
* Integrations: can it connect with your existing stack, like HubSpot, Notion, or Slack?
• Functionality: does it go beyond transcriptions and actually help you take action?
• Languages: can it transcribe and summarize meetings in different languages?
• Desktop and mobile apps: can you access it on Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android for on-the-go meeitngs?
• Recordings: is there support for saving and playing back audio and video recordings of meetings?
## Evaluating Krisp and Zoom AI
- **Krisp:**
  - Pros: Excellent noise cancellation for microphone and speaker audio, platform-agnostic, unlimited transcription, generous free plan.
  - Cons: Free plan limits, concise summaries, no real-time collab or multi-user features, can tax system resources.

- **Zoom AI:**
  - Pros: Native integration with Zoom, real-time Q&A and assistance, unique whiteboard AI, included with paid Zoom.

.
- Summaries are concise but not as in-depth as some competitors’ (geared toward quick recap).

- Can tax system resources during long meetings (CPU usage for AI processing)..
In general, users say that Zoom AI: - Native integration – no setup if you use Zoom, and outputs appear right in Zoom Chat​meetjamie.ai
.
- Real-time Q&A and assistance during meetings (ask the AI on the fly).
- Unique whiteboard AI for creating mind-maps/diagrams in meeting​meetjamie.ai
.
- Included with paid Zoom (no extra fee for existing Zoom subscribers)​news.zoom.us

.
- No free access – requires a Zoom paid plan (~$15+ monthly)​meetjamie.ai
.

.
- No custom vocabulary, so industry jargon may transcribe poorly​meetjamie.ai

- **Krisp**: People or companies looking for a free plan and an easy-to-use tool might consider Krisp. However, it lacks integrations with popular platforms like HubSpot and Notion, limiting its usefulness for those who rely on these tools for productivity.

- **Zoom AI**: Users who prioritize Zoom and calendar integration may find Zoom AI appealing. Nevertheless, its lack of support for in-person meetings and local recording could be a drawback for those who require these features. Additionally, the tool's limited language support and absence of a desktop app may hinder its effectiveness for a broader user base.
