# Krisp vs. Otter.ai – Which should you choose?  
AI meeting notes platforms provide four primary deliverables:  
  
* Transcripts create a word-for-word record of the meeting. For example, a one-hour product development meeting generates a searchable document containing every feature discussion, technical requirement, and team decision.  
* Action items are pulled directly from the conversation. When someone says "John will update the wireframes by Friday," the AI automatically creates a tracked task with the assignee and deadline.  
* Meeting summaries distill hour-long conversations into 2-3 paragraphs. A 45-minute sprint planning meeting becomes a concise overview of sprint goals, resource allocation, and key decisions.  
* Topic segmentation breaks discussions into labeled sections. A client call covering multiple projects is automatically divided into sections like "Website Redesign," "Q1 Marketing Campaign," and "Budget Review."  
  
In addition to the quality of these deliverables, we'll want to look at a number of other key factors:  
  
* Free trial: can you test it for free before committing?  
* Ease-of-use: does it have a simple, intuitive setup that works for non-technical users?  
* In-person meeting support: can it transcribe audio from live recordings or uploaded files, not just virtual calls?  
* Security and privacy: how is customer data handled on the platform?  
* Integrations: can it connect with your existing stack, like HubSpot, Notion, or Slack?  
* Functionality: does it go beyond transcriptions and actually help you take action?  
* Languages: can it transcribe and summarize meetings in different languages?  
* Desktop and mobile apps: can you access it on Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android for on-the-go meetings?  
* Recordings: is there support for saving and playing back audio and video recordings of meetings?    
## Evaluating Krisp and Otter.ai  
### Krisp
* Krisp combines noise cancellation with AI note-taking, offering audio cleanup during calls and automated meeting summaries with action items, though it has a 60-minute daily limit on the free tier and some users report audio distortion and high CPU usage. The tool's pricing can be steep for single-feature users, and customer support response times vary, while occasional voice distortion affects transcription quality.

### Otter.ai
* Otter.ai provides real-time transcription and meeting summaries with key themes, includes features for highlighting and commenting during meetings, and offers a generous free tier for basic use. The tool produces verbose transcripts that can be hard to parse, struggles with complex audio quality, and has meeting management issues including unwanted calendar invites, while the free version caps Zoom recordings at 40 minutes.  
## Comparison table    
Krisp makes sense for people who need a desktop app and want to record meetings in multiple languages, though its lack of mobile apps and automation features means you'll be doing most of the work manually. The tool works well enough for basic recording and transcription needs, but doesn't go far enough in helping users actually do something with their meeting content.

Otter.ai fits companies that want mobile access and some basic automation of their meeting workflows, especially if they only need English language support. While it offers more ways to process meetings after they happen, it still leaves users to figure out most of the post-meeting organization and follow-up on their own.
