# tldv vs Read.ai for meeting automation

tldv is a meeting assistant tool that records, transcribes, and summarizes meetings. It works with Zoom and Microsoft Teams through a desktop app for Windows and macOS, providing local recording capabilities. The system supports over 30 languages and offers AI-powered features including timestamps, highlights, and automated agents for note-taking and CRM data logging.

The tool has three pricing tiers: a free plan, Pro at $18/month, and Business at $59/month. It integrates with productivity platforms including HubSpot, Notion, Salesforce, and thousands of other services. tldv does not support in-person meetings and lacks a native mobile app, requiring desktop or browser access. Its functionality depends on internet connection quality for optimal performance.

Read.ai is a meeting copilot that transcribes and analyzes conversations in real-time. It provides live transcription during meetings and generates reports with key points, action items, speaker metrics, sentiment analysis, and attention scores. The platform integrates with Zoom, Teams, and Meet, and can also summarize Slack threads or emails. It supports 20+ languages and offers search functionality across all meeting transcripts.

The service has a tiered pricing structure starting with a free plan (5 meetings/month), followed by Pro ($19.75/user/month annually) and Enterprise tiers ($29.75-$40/user/month). Read.ai works for virtual meetings via browser extensions and can capture in-person meetings through its iOS app. It integrates with tools like HubSpot, Salesforce, Confluence, Jira, Notion, and Slack, though it lacks a dedicated desktop application or Android support.

## Comparing tldv and Read.ai

### tldv

* tldv offers AI meeting recording and transcription with focus on CRM integration through its desktop app for Zoom and Teams, but fails to support in-person meetings and lacks a mobile app. While it provides multi-language support and local recording capabilities, its integrations don't fully address post-meeting workflow needs beyond basic data capture.

### Read.ai

* Read.ai functions as a meeting analysis tool with engagement metrics and sentiment analysis on top of transcription, available through browser extensions and iOS app. Despite supporting in-person meetings and offering integrations with common platforms, its automation capabilities are limited in scope and don't effectively bridge the gap between capturing meeting content and facilitating action.

tldv is better suited for teams deeply integrated with CRM systems who primarily conduct virtual meetings and value simplicity. Its desktop-first approach and straightforward interface make it accessible for organizations with minimal technical requirements, though they'll need to look elsewhere for in-person meeting support or mobile functionality.

Read.ai appeals more to management teams concerned with meeting effectiveness metrics and teams working across languages or regions. Its analysis capabilities provide insight into team dynamics and meeting quality, making it valuable for organizations focused on improving communication patterns, though the limited free tier and higher learning curve may deter smaller teams or individual users.

## tldv vs Read.ai: What do users say?

User reviews of tldv highlight its accurate transcriptions, intuitive UI, and generous free plan, though some note limited platform support and privacy concerns. The service offers AI meeting recording, transcription, summarization, and integrates with numerous platforms including HubSpot and Salesforce. Pricing ranges from a free plan to Business ($59/month), with a desktop app available for Windows and macOS. Read.ai is positioned as an AI meeting "copilot" that goes beyond transcription to analyze engagement and sentiment during meetings. Users appreciate its rich feature set including meeting quality insights and integration capabilities, though some find the free tier too limited (only 5 meetings per month) and the UI potentially cluttered. Read.ai offers in-person meeting support via iOS app, supports 20+ languages, and provides robust integrations with tools like HubSpot and Notion.
