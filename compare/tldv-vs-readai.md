# tldv vs Read.ai – Feature and product comparison

Here's what you should look for in an AI meeting automation tool:  
* Transcripts that create a word-for-word record of the meeting. For example, a one-hour product development meeting generates a searchable document containing every feature discussion, technical requirement, and team decision.
* [Action items](/releases/add-action-items-to-meetings) are pulled directly from the conversation. When someone says "John will update the wireframes by Friday," the AI automatically creates a tracked task with the assignee and deadline.
* Meeting summaries distill hour-long conversations into 2-3 paragraphs. A 45-minute sprint planning meeting becomes a concise overview of sprint goals, resource allocation, and key decisions.
* Topic segmentation breaks discussions into labeled sections. A client call covering multiple projects is automatically divided into sections like "Website Redesign," "Q1 Marketing Campaign," and "Budget Review."

## Other key features
In addition to the quality of these deliverables, we'll want to look at a number of other key factors:
* Ease-of-use: does it have a simple, intuitive setup that works for non-technical users?
* In-person meeting support: can it transcribe audio from live recordings or uploaded files, not just virtual calls?
* Security and privacy: how is customer data handled on the platform?
* Integrations: can it connect with your existing stack, like HubSpot, Notion, or Slack?
* Functionality: does it go beyond transcriptions and actually help you take action?
* Languages: can it transcribe and summarize meetings in different languages?
* Desktop and mobile apps: can you access it on Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android for on-the-go meetings?

## Understanding tldv and Read.ai
tldv is a meeting assistant tool that records, transcribes, and summarizes meetings. It works with Zoom and Microsoft Teams through a desktop app for Windows and macOS, providing local recording capabilities. The system supports over 30 languages and offers AI-powered features including timestamps, highlights, and automated agents for note-taking and CRM data logging.

The tool has three pricing tiers: a free plan, Pro at $18/month, and Business at $59/month. It integrates with productivity platforms including HubSpot, Notion, Salesforce, and thousands of other services. tldv does not support in-person meetings and lacks a native mobile app, requiring desktop or browser access. Its functionality depends on internet connection quality for optimal performance.

Read.ai is a meeting copilot that transcribes and analyzes conversations in real-time. It provides live transcription during meetings and generates reports with key points, action items, speaker metrics, sentiment analysis, and attention scores. The platform integrates with Zoom, Teams, and Meet, and can also summarize Slack threads or emails. It supports 20+ languages and offers search functionality across all meeting transcripts.

The service has a tiered pricing structure starting with a free plan (5 meetings/month), followed by Pro ($19.75/user/month annually) and Enterprise tiers ($29.75-$40/user/month). Read.ai works for virtual meetings via browser extensions and can capture in-person meetings through its iOS app. It integrates with tools like HubSpot, Salesforce, Confluence, Jira, Notion, and Slack, though it lacks a dedicated desktop application or Android support.

## Comparing tldv and Read.ai

### tldv

* tldv offers AI meeting recording and transcription with focus on CRM integration through its desktop app for Zoom and Teams, but fails to support in-person meetings and lacks a mobile app. While it provides multi-language support and local recording capabilities, its integrations don't fully address post-meeting workflow needs beyond basic data capture.

### Read.ai

* Read.ai functions as a meeting analysis tool with engagement metrics and sentiment analysis on top of transcription, available through browser extensions and iOS app. Despite supporting in-person meetings and offering integrations with common platforms, its automation capabilities are limited in scope and don't effectively bridge the gap between capturing meeting content and facilitating action.

| Feature | tldv | Read.ai |
|---------|------|---------|
| Price Range | $0-$59/mo | $0-$40/mo |
| In-Person Meetings | ❌ | ✅ |
| Local Recording | ✅ | ✅ |
| Integration Depth | Limited Utility | Limited Utility |
| Automation | Basic CRM | Basic Analysis |
| Language Support | 30+ | 20+ |
| Desktop App | ✅ | ❌ |
| Mobile App | ❌ | iOS only |
| Free Plan | Generous | Restricted |

tldv is better suited for teams deeply integrated with CRM systems who primarily conduct virtual meetings and value simplicity. Its desktop-first approach and straightforward interface make it accessible for organizations with minimal technical requirements, though they'll need to look elsewhere for in-person meeting support or mobile functionality.

Read.ai appeals more to management teams concerned with meeting effectiveness metrics and teams working across languages or regions. Its analysis capabilities provide insight into team dynamics and meeting quality, making it valuable for organizations focused on improving communication patterns, though the limited free tier and higher learning curve may deter smaller teams or individual users.
