# Otter.ai vs. Read.ai – Which should you choose?  
AI meeting notes platforms provide four primary deliverables:  
  
* Transcripts create a word-for-word record of the meeting. For example, a one-hour product development meeting generates a searchable document containing every feature discussion, technical requirement, and team decision.  
* Action items are pulled directly from the conversation. When someone says "John will update the wireframes by Friday," the AI automatically creates a tracked task with the assignee and deadline.  
* Meeting summaries distill hour-long conversations into 2-3 paragraphs. A 45-minute sprint planning meeting becomes a concise overview of sprint goals, resource allocation, and key decisions.  
* Topic segmentation breaks discussions into labeled sections. A client call covering multiple projects is automatically divided into sections like "Website Redesign," "Q1 Marketing Campaign," and "Budget Review."  
  
In addition to the quality of these deliverables, we'll want to look at a number of other key factors:  
  
* Free trial: can you test it for free before committing?  
* Ease-of-use: does it have a simple, intuitive setup that works for non-technical users?  
* In-person meeting support: can it transcribe audio from live recordings or uploaded files, not just virtual calls?  
* Security and privacy: how is customer data handled on the platform?  
* Integrations: can it connect with your existing stack, like HubSpot, Notion, or Slack?  
* Functionality: does it go beyond transcriptions and actually help you take action?  
* Languages: can it transcribe and summarize meetings in different languages?  
* Desktop and mobile apps: can you access it on Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android for on-the-go meetings?  
* Recordings: is there support for saving and playing back audio and video recordings of meetings?    
## Evaluating Otter.ai and Read.ai  
### Otter.ai
* Otter.ai provides real-time transcription with commenting features and meeting summaries, works across video platforms, and offers a free tier with 40-minute meeting limits. The tool integrates with calendars for automatic meeting joining and note creation, though this can lead to unwanted meeting attendance if not properly configured.
* Transcripts can be difficult to parse due to verbosity and structure issues, while audio quality impacts transcription accuracy and speaker identification. The free tier restrictions and meeting duration caps limit functionality for some users.

### Read.ai
* Read.ai combines transcription with meeting analytics including engagement scores and speaker metrics, supports multiple languages with translation, and integrates with tools like Slack, Notion, and Confluence. The platform includes features for meeting quality assessment and documentation management across team workflows.
* The service has a restrictive free tier limited to 5 meetings monthly, presents a steeper learning curve due to interface complexity, and comes with higher pricing for full enterprise features. Some users report inconsistent performance with engagement metrics and have raised privacy concerns about unauthorized meeting access.  
## Comparison table    
Otter.ai works best for individuals and small teams who need basic meeting transcription and some light automation, though its limited integration options mean you'll still need to do most of the work manually. The tool offers enough features for simple use cases but falls short when you need to connect it deeply with other workplace tools.

Read.ai suits larger organizations looking for meeting analytics and insights, even though it lacks automation capabilities and meaningful integrations with major enterprise systems. While it provides good transcription and basic meeting intelligence, users still need separate tools to actually execute on meeting outcomes and action items.
