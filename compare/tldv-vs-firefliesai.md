# tldv vs Fireflies.ai for meeting automation

tldv is a meeting recording tool that captures audio, transcribes conversations, and generates AI summaries with timestamps and highlights. It offers local recording via desktop apps for Zoom and Teams, with support for over 30 languages. The platform integrates with business software including HubSpot, Notion, Salesforce, and thousands of other services, and deploys AI agents to automate recording, note-taking, and CRM data entry.

The service operates on a tiered pricing model with a free plan, Pro tier ($18/month), and Business tier ($59/month). It has desktop applications for Windows and macOS but lacks native mobile apps. The platform works for remote meetings but not in-person gatherings. Some limitations include restricted platform support, dependency on internet connection quality, and potential privacy issues reported by users.

Fireflies.ai is a cloud-based meeting assistant that joins virtual meetings as a bot participant to record, transcribe, and summarize discussions across platforms like Zoom, Teams, Google Meet, and Webex. It provides speaker-labeled transcripts, AI-generated summaries of key points and action items, and offers a keyword search function along with an AskFred chatbot to query meeting content. The tool works for in-person meetings via its mobile app, supports transcription in over 100 languages, and integrates with services like HubSpot, Salesforce, Slack, and Asana.

The service operates on a tiered pricing model with a free plan offering limited monthly credits, a Pro plan at approximately $10/user/month for unlimited audio recording and transcripts, and a Business plan at about $19/user/month that adds video recording and advanced analytics. While Fireflies has no dedicated desktop application (using web app/Chrome extension instead), it does offer iOS and Android mobile apps and supports local recording through in-app recording and offline file upload for transcription.

## Comparing tldv and Fireflies.ai

### tldv
* tldv offers AI recording, transcription, and summarization capabilities with CRM integration. The platform provides accurate transcriptions and an intuitive UI but suffers from limited platform support and dependency on internet quality.
* While tldv includes integration with HubSpot, Notion, and thousands of other services, the depth of these integrations may not fully address post-meeting workflow needs. The tool falls short in bridging the gap between capturing meeting content and helping users turn that content into actionable outcomes.

### Fireflies.ai
* Fireflies.ai works as a cloud-based meeting assistant that joins calls to record, transcribe, and generate summaries with support for multiple meeting platforms. It delivers quick summaries and integrates with various tools, but struggles with transcription accuracy for accents and technical jargon.
* Despite offering dozens of integrations with CRM and project management tools, Fireflies.ai doesn't fully solve the problem of efficiently turning meeting insights into completed tasks. The integration capabilities, while numerous, lack the depth needed to truly automate post-meeting workflows.

tldv is better suited for teams that primarily use Zoom or Teams and require deeper CRM integration within a desktop-focused workflow. Its higher price point reflects more comprehensive AI agent capabilities and business features, making it appropriate for sales teams and enterprises with established meeting processes who don't need mobile access or in-person recording.

Fireflies.ai works better for mobile professionals, distributed teams using various meeting platforms, and those requiring in-person recording capabilities. Its more affordable pricing and broader platform support make it accessible for smaller teams and individuals, though the lack of a desktop app and more limited integration depth may frustrate power users looking to fully automate their meeting workflows.

## tldv vs Fireflies.ai: What do users say?
