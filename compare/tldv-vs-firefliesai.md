# tldv vs Fireflies.ai – Feature and product comparison

AI meeting notes platforms provide four primary deliverables:
* Transcripts that create a word-for-word record of the meeting. For example, a one-hour product development meeting generates a searchable document containing every feature discussion, technical requirement, and team decision.
* Action items are pulled directly from the conversation. When someone says "John will update the wireframes by Friday," the AI automatically creates a tracked task with the assignee and deadline.
* Meeting summaries distill hour-long conversations into 2-3 paragraphs. A 45-minute sprint planning meeting becomes a concise overview of sprint goals, resource allocation, and key decisions.
* Topic segmentation breaks discussions into labeled sections. A client call covering multiple projects is automatically divided into sections like "Website Redesign," "Q1 Marketing Campaign," and "Budget Review."

In addition to the quality of these deliverables, we'll want to look at a number of other key factors:
* Ease-of-use: does it have a simple, intuitive setup that works for non-technical users?
* In-person meeting support: can it transcribe audio from live recordings or uploaded files, not just virtual calls?
* Security and privacy: how is customer data handled on the platform?
* Integrations: can it connect with your existing stack, like HubSpot, Notion, or Slack?
* Functionality: does it go beyond transcriptions and actually help you take action?
* Languages: can it transcribe and summarize meetings in different languages?
* Desktop and mobile apps: can you access it on Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android for on-the-go meetings?

## About tldv
tldv is a meeting recording tool that captures audio, transcribes conversations, and generates AI summaries with timestamps and highlights. It offers local recording via desktop apps for Zoom and Teams, with support for over 30 languages. The platform integrates with business software including HubSpot, Notion, Salesforce, and thousands of other services, and deploys AI agents to automate recording, note-taking, and CRM data entry.

The service operates on a tiered pricing model with a free plan, Pro tier ($18/month), and Business tier ($59/month). It has desktop applications for Windows and macOS but lacks native mobile apps. The platform works for remote meetings but not in-person gatherings. Some limitations include restricted platform support, dependency on internet connection quality, and potential privacy issues reported by users.

## About Fireflies.ai
Fireflies.ai is a cloud-based meeting assistant that joins virtual meetings as a bot participant to record, transcribe, and summarize discussions across platforms like Zoom, Teams, Google Meet, and Webex. It provides speaker-labeled transcripts, AI-generated summaries of key points and action items, and offers a keyword search function along with an AskFred chatbot to query meeting content. The tool works for in-person meetings via its mobile app, supports transcription in over 100 languages, and integrates with services like HubSpot, Salesforce, Slack, and Asana.

The service operates on a tiered pricing model with a free plan offering limited monthly credits, a Pro plan at approximately $10/user/month for unlimited audio recording and transcripts, and a Business plan at about $19/user/month that adds video recording and advanced analytics. While Fireflies has no dedicated desktop application (using web app/Chrome extension instead), it does offer iOS and Android mobile apps and supports local recording through in-app recording and offline file upload for transcription.

## Comparison
### tldv
* tldv offers AI recording, transcription, and summarization capabilities with CRM integration. The platform provides accurate transcriptions and an intuitive UI but suffers from limited platform support and dependency on internet quality.
* While tldv includes integration with HubSpot, Notion, and thousands of other services, the depth of these integrations may not fully address post-meeting workflow needs. The tool falls short in bridging the gap between capturing meeting content and helping users turn that content into actionable outcomes.

### Fireflies.ai
* Fireflies.ai works as a cloud-based meeting assistant that joins calls to record, transcribe, and generate summaries with support for multiple meeting platforms. It delivers quick summaries and integrates with various tools, but struggles with transcription accuracy for accents and technical jargon.
* Despite offering dozens of integrations with CRM and project management tools, Fireflies.ai doesn't fully solve the problem of efficiently turning meeting insights into completed tasks. The integration capabilities, while numerous, lack the depth needed to truly automate post-meeting workflows.

| Feature | tldv | Fireflies.ai |
|---------|------|-------------|
| Pricing | $18-59/mo | $10-19/mo |
| In-person meetings | ❌ | ✅ |
| Local recording | ✅ | ✅ |

tldv is better suited for teams that primarily use Zoom or Teams and require deeper CRM integration within a desktop-focused workflow. Its higher price point reflects more comprehensive AI agent capabilities and business features, making it appropriate for sales teams and enterprises with established meeting processes who don't need mobile access or in-person recording.

Fireflies.ai works better for mobile professionals, distributed teams using various meeting platforms, and those requiring in-person recording capabilities. Its more affordable pricing and broader platform support make it accessible for smaller teams and individuals, though the lack of a desktop app and more limited integration depth may frustrate power users looking to fully automate their meeting workflows.
