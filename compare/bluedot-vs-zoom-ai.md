# Bluedot vs. Zoom AI – Which should you choose?  
AI meeting notes platforms provide four primary deliverables:  
  
* Transcripts create a word-for-word record of the meeting. For example, a one-hour product development meeting generates a searchable document containing every feature discussion, technical requirement, and team decision.  
* Action items are pulled directly from the conversation. When someone says "John will update the wireframes by Friday," the AI automatically creates a tracked task with the assignee and deadline.  
* Meeting summaries distill hour-long conversations into 2-3 paragraphs. A 45-minute sprint planning meeting becomes a concise overview of sprint goals, resource allocation, and key decisions.  
* Topic segmentation breaks discussions into labeled sections. A client call covering multiple projects is automatically divided into sections like "Website Redesign," "Q1 Marketing Campaign," and "Budget Review."  
  
In addition to the quality of these deliverables, we'll want to look at a number of other key factors:  
  
* Free trial: can you test it for free before committing?  
* Ease-of-use: does it have a simple, intuitive setup that works for non-technical users?  
* In-person meeting support: can it transcribe audio from live recordings or uploaded files, not just virtual calls?  
* Security and privacy: how is customer data handled on the platform?  
* Integrations: can it connect with your existing stack, like HubSpot, Notion, or Slack?  
* Functionality: does it go beyond transcriptions and actually help you take action?  
* Languages: can it transcribe and summarize meetings in different languages?  
* Desktop and mobile apps: can you access it on Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android for on-the-go meetings?  
* Recordings: is there support for saving and playing back audio and video recordings of meetings?    
## Evaluating Bluedot and Zoom AI  
### Bluedot
* Bluedot offers accurate transcription without requiring bot invites, works across meeting platforms, and integrates with common apps for automatic note syncing. The tool runs in the background and functions even when not hosting meetings, with support for all major meeting platforms.
* The free tier is limited to 5 lifetime meetings, requires Chrome for best performance, and lacks mature mobile support. Higher tier plans are expensive compared to competitors, with some features like extended recordings and custom templates restricted to premium plans.

### Zoom AI
* Zoom AI integrates directly into Zoom meetings without extra setup, generates instant meeting summaries with action items, and comes included with paid Zoom accounts. The tool activates automatically to track meeting content once enabled.
* The service only works within Zoom meetings, excludes free Zoom users from full features, and offers basic meeting management compared to dedicated tools. Chat integration is limited and some users report difficulty accessing AI notes outside of Zoom.  
## Comparison table    
Bluedot seems best suited for teams that meet in person and need basic automation of their meeting workflows, though its integration options are still developing. The tool offers local recording and some automation features that could help small to medium teams capture and process their discussions more efficiently.

Zoom AI appears targeted at remote-first companies who already use Zoom and want AI features without switching platforms, though it lacks meaningful integrations with other tools. Its mobile-first approach and language support make it convenient for distributed teams, but the automation capabilities are too limited to meaningfully improve meeting outcomes.
