# Krisp vs. Granola – Which should you choose?  
AI meeting notes platforms provide four primary deliverables:  
  
* Transcripts create a word-for-word record of the meeting. For example, a one-hour product development meeting generates a searchable document containing every feature discussion, technical requirement, and team decision.  
* Action items are pulled directly from the conversation. When someone says "John will update the wireframes by Friday," the AI automatically creates a tracked task with the assignee and deadline.  
* Meeting summaries distill hour-long conversations into 2-3 paragraphs. A 45-minute sprint planning meeting becomes a concise overview of sprint goals, resource allocation, and key decisions.  
* Topic segmentation breaks discussions into labeled sections. A client call covering multiple projects is automatically divided into sections like "Website Redesign," "Q1 Marketing Campaign," and "Budget Review."  
  
In addition to the quality of these deliverables, we'll want to look at a number of other key factors:  
  
* Free trial: can you test it for free before committing?  
* Ease-of-use: does it have a simple, intuitive setup that works for non-technical users?  
* In-person meeting support: can it transcribe audio from live recordings or uploaded files, not just virtual calls?  
* Security and privacy: how is customer data handled on the platform?  
* Integrations: can it connect with your existing stack, like HubSpot, Notion, or Slack?  
* Functionality: does it go beyond transcriptions and actually help you take action?  
* Languages: can it transcribe and summarize meetings in different languages?  
* Desktop and mobile apps: can you access it on Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android for on-the-go meetings?  
* Recordings: is there support for saving and playing back audio and video recordings of meetings?    
## Evaluating Krisp and Granola  
### Krisp
* Krisp provides noise cancellation for all audio and unlimited transcription across platforms, with a free tier offering 60 minutes daily noise removal and two summaries per day. The software works with any meeting tool but can be resource-intensive during extended use, and lacks real-time collaboration features since it's designed for individual use.

### Granola
* Granola functions as a simple notepad that transcribes meetings through device audio without requiring a bot, and includes customizable templates for notes. The tool is currently limited to MacOS, has minimal third-party integrations, and lacks collaborative features while some core functionality remains in development.  
## Comparison table    
Krisp makes sense for global teams who need to record meetings in multiple languages and want mobile access, though its lack of calendar and CRM integrations means you'll still be doing most of the work manually. The desktop apps work well for basic recording needs, and the free plan lets you try things out without much friction.

Granola works best for Mac-based teams who just need simple meeting recordings in English and don't mind being tethered to their desktops. While it handles the basics of recording well enough, the missing integrations with common workplace tools means you'll spend extra time moving information around after meetings end.
