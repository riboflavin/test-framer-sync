# Krisp vs. Granola: Which should you choose?
AI meeting notes platforms provide four primary deliverables:

• Transcripts create a word-for-word record of the meeting. For example, a one-hour product development meeting generates a searchable document containing every feature discussion, technical requirement, and team decision.
• Action items are pulled directly from the conversation. When someone says "John will update the wireframes by Friday," the AI automatically creates a tracked task with the assignee and deadline.
• Meeting summaries distill hour-long conversations into 2-3 paragraphs. A 45-minute sprint planning meeting becomes a concise overview of sprint goals, resource allocation, and key decisions.
• Topic segmentation breaks discussions into labeled sections. A client call covering multiple projects is automatically divided into sections like "Website Redesign," "Q1 Marketing Campaign," and "Budget Review."

In addition to the quality of these deliverables, we'll want to look at a number of other key factors:

• Free trial: can you test it for free before committing?
• Ease-of-use: does it have a simple, intuitive setup that works for non-technical users?
• In-person meeting support: can it transcribe audio from live recordings or uploaded files, not just virtual calls?
• Security and privacy: how is customer data handled on the platform?
• Integrations: can it connect with your existing stack, like HubSpot, Notion, or Slack?
• Functionality: does it go beyond transcriptions and actually help you take action?
• Languages: can it transcribe and summarize meetings in different languages?
• Desktop and mobile apps: can you access it on Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android for on-the-go meeitngs?
• Recordings: is there support for saving and playing back audio and video recordings of meetings?
## Evaluating Krisp and Granola
Krisp:
- Pros: Excellent noise cancellation for microphone and speaker audio, platform-agnostic, unlimited transcription, generous free plan with custom vocabulary.

Krisp might appeal to individuals or companies looking for a straightforward and user-friendly tool for remote meetings, especially those who prioritize in-person interactions and local recording. However, its lack of integrations with popular platforms like Zoom and Calendar, as well as limited language support, may hinder its usefulness for those seeking a more comprehensive solution.

On the other hand, Granola could be suitable for users who value simplicity and ease of use, particularly on Mac devices. While it offers basic features like local recording and desktop app support, its absence of key integrations with tools like HubSpot and limited mobile app availability may limit its effectiveness in helping users streamline their meeting workflows and productivity.
