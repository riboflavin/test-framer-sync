# Krisp vs. Granola: Which should you choose?  
AI meeting notes platforms provide four primary deliverables:  
  
* Transcripts create a word-for-word record of the meeting. For example, a one-hour product development meeting generates a searchable document containing every feature discussion, technical requirement, and team decision.  
* Action items are pulled directly from the conversation. When someone says "John will update the wireframes by Friday," the AI automatically creates a tracked task with the assignee and deadline.  
* Meeting summaries distill hour-long conversations into 2-3 paragraphs. A 45-minute sprint planning meeting becomes a concise overview of sprint goals, resource allocation, and key decisions.  
* Topic segmentation breaks discussions into labeled sections. A client call covering multiple projects is automatically divided into sections like "Website Redesign," "Q1 Marketing Campaign," and "Budget Review."  
  
In addition to the quality of these deliverables, we'll want to look at a number of other key factors:  
  
* Free trial: can you test it for free before committing?  
* Ease-of-use: does it have a simple, intuitive setup that works for non-technical users?  
* In-person meeting support: can it transcribe audio from live recordings or uploaded files, not just virtual calls?  
* Security and privacy: how is customer data handled on the platform?  
* Integrations: can it connect with your existing stack, like HubSpot, Notion, or Slack?  
* Functionality: does it go beyond transcriptions and actually help you take action?  
* Languages: can it transcribe and summarize meetings in different languages?  
* Desktop and mobile apps: can you access it on Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android for on-the-go meetings?  
* Recordings: is there support for saving and playing back audio and video recordings of meetings?    
## Evaluating Krisp and Granola  
Krisp:
- Pros: Excellent noise cancellation, platform-agnostic, unlimited transcription, generous free plan.
- Cons: Free plan limits, summaries not as in-depth, no real-time collab, can tax system resources.

Granola:
- Pros: Minimal user-friendly app, no meeting bot needed, custom templates, accurate transcription quality.
- Cons: MacOS only, few integrations, lacks multi-user features, basic capabilities due to new product.

| Easy to Use?                      | ✅ Yes              | ✅ Super easy      |
| Good for In-Person Meetings?      | ✅ Yes              | ✅ Yes             |
| Good for Local Recording?         | ✅ Yes              | ✅ Yes             |
| Integrates with HubSpot, Notion, etc.? | ❌ No           | ❌ No              |
| Automation Engine?                | ❌ No               | ❌ No              |
| Language Support                  | ✅ Multiple languages | ❌ English only |
| Desktop App                       | ✅ Yes (Mac & Windows) | ✅ Yes (Mac-only) |
| iPhone & Android Apps             | ✅ Yes (Both)       | ❌ No              |  
- Krisp may appeal to individuals or companies looking for a straightforward and user-friendly tool for remote meetings, especially those who prioritize ease of use and local recording capabilities. However, both tools lack integrations with popular platforms like Zoom and HubSpot, limiting their usefulness for users who rely on these services for their meetings.

- Granola could be suitable for users seeking a simple solution for in-person meetings and local recording, particularly those who prefer Mac devices. Nevertheless, the absence of integrations with common tools like Zoom and Notion, as well as the lack of an automation engine, may hinder its ability to fully support users in achieving their meeting objectives.
