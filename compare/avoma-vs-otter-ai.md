# Avoma vs. Otter.ai – Which should you choose?  
AI meeting notes platforms provide four primary deliverables:  
  
* Transcripts create a word-for-word record of the meeting. For example, a one-hour product development meeting generates a searchable document containing every feature discussion, technical requirement, and team decision.  
* Action items are pulled directly from the conversation. When someone says "John will update the wireframes by Friday," the AI automatically creates a tracked task with the assignee and deadline.  
* Meeting summaries distill hour-long conversations into 2-3 paragraphs. A 45-minute sprint planning meeting becomes a concise overview of sprint goals, resource allocation, and key decisions.  
* Topic segmentation breaks discussions into labeled sections. A client call covering multiple projects is automatically divided into sections like "Website Redesign," "Q1 Marketing Campaign," and "Budget Review."  
  
In addition to the quality of these deliverables, we'll want to look at a number of other key factors:  
  
* Free trial: can you test it for free before committing?  
* Ease-of-use: does it have a simple, intuitive setup that works for non-technical users?  
* In-person meeting support: can it transcribe audio from live recordings or uploaded files, not just virtual calls?  
* Security and privacy: how is customer data handled on the platform?  
* Integrations: can it connect with your existing stack, like HubSpot, Notion, or Slack?  
* Functionality: does it go beyond transcriptions and actually help you take action?  
* Languages: can it transcribe and summarize meetings in different languages?  
* Desktop and mobile apps: can you access it on Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android for on-the-go meetings?  
* Recordings: is there support for saving and playing back audio and video recordings of meetings?    
## Evaluating Avoma and Otter.ai  
### Avoma
* Avoma provides highly accurate transcription at 95% even with accents and jargon, integrates with common tools like Zoom and Slack, and includes administrative task automation. The platform offers comprehensive meeting management features and responsive support, though some find it too complex for basic transcription needs and note occasional technical delays.

### Otter.ai
* Otter.ai focuses on simple transcription and note-taking with real-time capabilities and AI-generated meeting summaries, plus includes features for highlighting and commenting during meetings. The service can produce overly detailed transcripts that lack structure, struggles with complex audio quality, and requires careful configuration to avoid unwanted meeting joins.  
## Comparison table    
Avoma works best for sales teams and companies who need to track conversations in multiple languages, though its limited integration set means you'll still need other tools to act on what you learn. The tool can handle most meeting scenarios but falls short when you need to deeply integrate with your existing workflow.

Otter.ai fits well for journalists, researchers, and English-only teams who want simple meeting transcripts without much overhead, even though its basic automation features don't help much with post-meeting tasks. Its mobile-first approach works for people who take lots of notes on the go, but you'll need additional tools to make those notes actionable.
