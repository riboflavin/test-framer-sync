# Avoma vs. Otter.ai – Which should you choose?  
AI meeting notes platforms provide four primary deliverables:  
  
* Transcripts create a word-for-word record of the meeting. For example, a one-hour product development meeting generates a searchable document containing every feature discussion, technical requirement, and team decision.  
* Action items are pulled directly from the conversation. When someone says "John will update the wireframes by Friday," the AI automatically creates a tracked task with the assignee and deadline.  
* Meeting summaries distill hour-long conversations into 2-3 paragraphs. A 45-minute sprint planning meeting becomes a concise overview of sprint goals, resource allocation, and key decisions.  
* Topic segmentation breaks discussions into labeled sections. A client call covering multiple projects is automatically divided into sections like "Website Redesign," "Q1 Marketing Campaign," and "Budget Review."  
  
In addition to the quality of these deliverables, we'll want to look at a number of other key factors:  
  
* Free trial: can you test it for free before committing?  
* Ease-of-use: does it have a simple, intuitive setup that works for non-technical users?  
* In-person meeting support: can it transcribe audio from live recordings or uploaded files, not just virtual calls?  
* Security and privacy: how is customer data handled on the platform?  
* Integrations: can it connect with your existing stack, like HubSpot, Notion, or Slack?  
* Functionality: does it go beyond transcriptions and actually help you take action?  
* Languages: can it transcribe and summarize meetings in different languages?  
* Desktop and mobile apps: can you access it on Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android for on-the-go meetings?  
* Recordings: is there support for saving and playing back audio and video recordings of meetings?    
## Evaluating Avoma and Otter.ai  
### Avoma
* Avoma provides accurate transcription with clear speaker labeling and AI summaries, plus integrations for CRM, calendar and workflow automation. The platform requires paid plans starting at $59-79 per user monthly and has no free tier beyond trials.

### Otter.ai
* Otter.ai offers an intuitive interface with live transcript editing and includes a free plan with generous limits, plus Zoom and calendar integrations for automatic recording. The service struggles with accented speech, only supports English, and sometimes requires manual fixes for speaker identification.  
## Comparison table    
Avoma makes sense for sales teams and companies who need their meeting notes to flow into HubSpot and other business tools. The automation features and business integrations help teams stay organized, though the learning curve and lack of a free plan might put off smaller organizations or individuals.

Otter works well for students, freelancers, and small teams who just need simple meeting transcripts and basic sharing features. The free plan and ease of use make it accessible to anyone, but the limited integrations and lack of automation mean users still need to do most of the work manually.
