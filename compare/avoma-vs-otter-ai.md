# Avoma vs. Otter.ai – Which should you choose?  
AI meeting notes platforms provide four primary deliverables:  
  
* Transcripts create a word-for-word record of the meeting. For example, a one-hour product development meeting generates a searchable document containing every feature discussion, technical requirement, and team decision.  
* Action items are pulled directly from the conversation. When someone says "John will update the wireframes by Friday," the AI automatically creates a tracked task with the assignee and deadline.  
* Meeting summaries distill hour-long conversations into 2-3 paragraphs. A 45-minute sprint planning meeting becomes a concise overview of sprint goals, resource allocation, and key decisions.  
* Topic segmentation breaks discussions into labeled sections. A client call covering multiple projects is automatically divided into sections like "Website Redesign," "Q1 Marketing Campaign," and "Budget Review."  
  
In addition to the quality of these deliverables, we'll want to look at a number of other key factors:  
  
* Free trial: can you test it for free before committing?  
* Ease-of-use: does it have a simple, intuitive setup that works for non-technical users?  
* In-person meeting support: can it transcribe audio from live recordings or uploaded files, not just virtual calls?  
* Security and privacy: how is customer data handled on the platform?  
* Integrations: can it connect with your existing stack, like HubSpot, Notion, or Slack?  
* Functionality: does it go beyond transcriptions and actually help you take action?  
* Languages: can it transcribe and summarize meetings in different languages?  
* Desktop and mobile apps: can you access it on Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android for on-the-go meetings?  
* Recordings: is there support for saving and playing back audio and video recordings of meetings?    
## Evaluating Avoma and Otter.ai  
### Avoma
* Avoma provides highly accurate transcription at 95% even with accents and jargon, integrates with common tools like Zoom and Slack, and includes administrative task automation. The platform offers comprehensive meeting management features and responsive support, though some find it too complex for basic transcription needs and note occasional technical delays.

### Otter.ai
* Otter.ai focuses on simple transcription and note-taking with real-time capabilities and AI-generated meeting summaries, plus includes features for highlighting and commenting during meetings. The service can produce overly detailed transcripts that lack structure, struggles with complex audio quality, and requires careful configuration to avoid unwanted meeting joins.  
## Comparison table    
Avoma makes sense for global companies and sales teams who need to record meetings in multiple languages and want basic workflow automation, though its integration ecosystem isn't as mature as you'd expect for a business tool. The lack of a desktop app and limited free tier suggest it's built more for occasional use than as a core part of daily operations.

Otter works well for individuals and small teams who mostly speak English and want a simple way to record and transcribe meetings, with its generous free plan being a key draw. While it offers some automation and integration capabilities, it doesn't go deep enough to truly streamline post-meeting workflows or meaningfully connect with other business tools.
