# Fathom vs. Otter.ai: Which should you choose?
AI meeting notes platforms provide four primary deliverables:

• Transcripts create a word-for-word record of the meeting. For example, a one-hour product development meeting generates a searchable document containing every feature discussion, technical requirement, and team decision.
• Action items are pulled directly from the conversation. When someone says "John will update the wireframes by Friday," the AI automatically creates a tracked task with the assignee and deadline.
• Meeting summaries distill hour-long conversations into 2-3 paragraphs. A 45-minute sprint planning meeting becomes a concise overview of sprint goals, resource allocation, and key decisions.
• Topic segmentation breaks discussions into labeled sections. A client call covering multiple projects is automatically divided into sections like "Website Redesign," "Q1 Marketing Campaign," and "Budget Review."

In addition to the quality of these deliverables, we'll want to look at a number of other key factors:

• Free trial: can you test it for free before committing?
• Ease-of-use: does it have a simple, intuitive setup that works for non-technical users?
• In-person meeting support: can it transcribe audio from live recordings or uploaded files, not just virtual calls?
• Security and privacy: how is customer data handled on the platform?
• Integrations: can it connect with your existing stack, like HubSpot, Notion, or Slack?
• Functionality: does it go beyond transcriptions and actually help you take action?
• Languages: can it transcribe and summarize meetings in different languages?
• Desktop and mobile apps: can you access it on Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android for on-the-go meeitngs?
• Recordings: is there support for saving and playing back audio and video recordings of meetings?
## Evaluating Fathom and Otter.ai
Fathom offers top-notch accuracy in transcripts with multiple speakers, quick summaries, free core features, and support for multiple languages. However, it historically only supported Zoom, has some duplicate note issues, and lacks live collaboration features.

On the other hand, Otter.ai is praised for its easy-to-use interface, strong free plan, and seamless integration with Zoom and calendars. However, users have reported transcription errors with accents or fast speech, limited language support to English only, and hit-or-miss speaker identification that may require manual corrections.

Fathom might appeal to individuals or companies looking for a free and easy-to-use tool with Zoom and calendar integration, especially those using HubSpot or Notion. However, its limitations in supporting in-person meetings and local recording may hinder its usefulness in practical scenarios.

On the other hand, Otter.ai could attract users seeking a free plan with Zoom and calendar integration, along with mobile apps for both iPhone and Android. Yet, its lack of deep integrations with popular platforms and absence of an automation engine might leave users wanting more in terms of productivity and meeting efficiency.
