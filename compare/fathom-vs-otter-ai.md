# Fathom vs. Otter.ai – Which should you choose?  
AI meeting notes platforms provide four primary deliverables:  
  
* Transcripts create a word-for-word record of the meeting. For example, a one-hour product development meeting generates a searchable document containing every feature discussion, technical requirement, and team decision.  
* Action items are pulled directly from the conversation. When someone says "John will update the wireframes by Friday," the AI automatically creates a tracked task with the assignee and deadline.  
* Meeting summaries distill hour-long conversations into 2-3 paragraphs. A 45-minute sprint planning meeting becomes a concise overview of sprint goals, resource allocation, and key decisions.  
* Topic segmentation breaks discussions into labeled sections. A client call covering multiple projects is automatically divided into sections like "Website Redesign," "Q1 Marketing Campaign," and "Budget Review."  
  
In addition to the quality of these deliverables, we'll want to look at a number of other key factors:  
  
* Free trial: can you test it for free before committing?  
* Ease-of-use: does it have a simple, intuitive setup that works for non-technical users?  
* In-person meeting support: can it transcribe audio from live recordings or uploaded files, not just virtual calls?  
* Security and privacy: how is customer data handled on the platform?  
* Integrations: can it connect with your existing stack, like HubSpot, Notion, or Slack?  
* Functionality: does it go beyond transcriptions and actually help you take action?  
* Languages: can it transcribe and summarize meetings in different languages?  
* Desktop and mobile apps: can you access it on Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android for on-the-go meetings?  
* Recordings: is there support for saving and playing back audio and video recordings of meetings?    
## Evaluating Fathom and Otter.ai  
### Fathom
* Fathom offers real-time transcription and AI summaries for live meetings, with a free tier that includes core features and an interface focused on simplicity. The platform works through desktop browsers for live meetings only, generates different summary formats, and includes meeting templates in paid tiers, though it lacks external audio upload and mobile apps.

### Otter.ai
* Otter.ai provides transcription and note-taking for meetings with real-time features, highlighting tools, and AI-generated summaries of key themes, along with a free tier that includes basic functionality. The service can produce verbose transcripts that may lack structure, has accuracy issues with complex audio, and includes meeting management features that require careful configuration to avoid unwanted calendar interactions.  
## Comparison table    
Fathom is best suited for remote-first teams and sales organizations who need advanced language support and desktop-based workflows. While it offers some basic integrations with popular tools like HubSpot and Notion, its lack of mobile apps and in-person recording capabilities limit its usefulness for hybrid teams.

Otter works well for individuals and teams who frequently switch between in-person and remote meetings, with strong mobile support and local recording options. Though it connects with common workplace tools and offers good automation features, its limited language support and lack of a desktop app make it less ideal for global enterprise use.
