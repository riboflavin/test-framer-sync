# Granola vs. Otter.ai – Which should you choose?  
AI meeting notes platforms provide four primary deliverables:  
  
* Transcripts create a word-for-word record of the meeting. For example, a one-hour product development meeting generates a searchable document containing every feature discussion, technical requirement, and team decision.  
* Action items are pulled directly from the conversation. When someone says "John will update the wireframes by Friday," the AI automatically creates a tracked task with the assignee and deadline.  
* Meeting summaries distill hour-long conversations into 2-3 paragraphs. A 45-minute sprint planning meeting becomes a concise overview of sprint goals, resource allocation, and key decisions.  
* Topic segmentation breaks discussions into labeled sections. A client call covering multiple projects is automatically divided into sections like "Website Redesign," "Q1 Marketing Campaign," and "Budget Review."  
  
In addition to the quality of these deliverables, we'll want to look at a number of other key factors:  
  
* Free trial: can you test it for free before committing?  
* Ease-of-use: does it have a simple, intuitive setup that works for non-technical users?  
* In-person meeting support: can it transcribe audio from live recordings or uploaded files, not just virtual calls?  
* Security and privacy: how is customer data handled on the platform?  
* Integrations: can it connect with your existing stack, like HubSpot, Notion, or Slack?  
* Functionality: does it go beyond transcriptions and actually help you take action?  
* Languages: can it transcribe and summarize meetings in different languages?  
* Desktop and mobile apps: can you access it on Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android for on-the-go meetings?  
* Recordings: is there support for saving and playing back audio and video recordings of meetings?    
## Evaluating Granola and Otter.ai  
### Granola
* Granola works by listening directly on your device without needing a meeting bot, includes custom note templates for summaries, and provides accurate transcription to capture missed details. The app is currently MacOS-only with limited integrations, lacks multi-user collaboration features, and offers basic transcript editing capabilities as a newer product.

### Otter.ai
* Otter.ai provides live transcript editing and integrates with Zoom and calendars for automatic meeting recording, with a free plan that includes substantial transcription allowances. The service struggles with accented speech and rapid conversation, only works in English, and sometimes requires manual correction of speaker identification in transcripts.  
## Comparison table    
Small teams and freelancers who primarily do in-person meetings or want local recordings would find Granola useful, though they'll need to handle follow-up tasks manually. The Mac-only desktop app and English-only support limit its reach, but the simple interface makes it accessible for basic meeting capture needs.

Remote teams and companies heavily using Zoom will gravitate toward Otter.ai for its calendar integration and mobile apps, despite its limited third-party integrations. While it works well for virtual meetings, the lack of automation features means users still need other tools to actually execute on meeting outcomes and action items.
