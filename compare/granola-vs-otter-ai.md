# Granola vs. Otter.ai: Which should you choose?
AI meeting notes platforms provide four primary deliverables:

• Transcripts create a word-for-word record of the meeting. For example, a one-hour product development meeting generates a searchable document containing every feature discussion, technical requirement, and team decision.
• Action items are pulled directly from the conversation. When someone says "John will update the wireframes by Friday," the AI automatically creates a tracked task with the assignee and deadline.
• Meeting summaries distill hour-long conversations into 2-3 paragraphs. A 45-minute sprint planning meeting becomes a concise overview of sprint goals, resource allocation, and key decisions.
• Topic segmentation breaks discussions into labeled sections. A client call covering multiple projects is automatically divided into sections like "Website Redesign," "Q1 Marketing Campaign," and "Budget Review."

In addition to the quality of these deliverables, we'll want to look at a number of other key factors:

• Free trial: can you test it for free before committing?
• Ease-of-use: does it have a simple, intuitive setup that works for non-technical users?
• In-person meeting support: can it transcribe audio from live recordings or uploaded files, not just virtual calls?
• Security and privacy: how is customer data handled on the platform?
• Integrations: can it connect with your existing stack, like HubSpot, Notion, or Slack?
• Functionality: does it go beyond transcriptions and actually help you take action?
• Languages: can it transcribe and summarize meetings in different languages?
• Desktop and mobile apps: can you access it on Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android for on-the-go meeitngs?
• Recordings: is there support for saving and playing back audio and video recordings of meetings?

Granola might appeal to individuals or companies looking for a straightforward tool with a free trial, easy usability, and support for in-person meetings and local recording. However, its lack of integrations with popular platforms like Zoom and limited language support could hinder its usefulness for those seeking a more comprehensive solution.

On the other hand, Otter.ai could be attractive to users who prioritize integration with Zoom and calendars, as well as the availability of mobile apps for both iPhone and Android. Nevertheless, its limited integrations with other tools like HubSpot and Notion, along with the absence of an automation engine, may limit its effectiveness in helping users efficiently manage their meetings and tasks.
