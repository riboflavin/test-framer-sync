# Granola vs. Otter.ai: Which should you choose?  
AI meeting notes platforms provide four primary deliverables:  
  
* Transcripts create a word-for-word record of the meeting. For example, a one-hour product development meeting generates a searchable document containing every feature discussion, technical requirement, and team decision.  
* Action items are pulled directly from the conversation. When someone says "John will update the wireframes by Friday," the AI automatically creates a tracked task with the assignee and deadline.  
* Meeting summaries distill hour-long conversations into 2-3 paragraphs. A 45-minute sprint planning meeting becomes a concise overview of sprint goals, resource allocation, and key decisions.  
* Topic segmentation breaks discussions into labeled sections. A client call covering multiple projects is automatically divided into sections like "Website Redesign," "Q1 Marketing Campaign," and "Budget Review."  
  
In addition to the quality of these deliverables, we'll want to look at a number of other key factors:  
  
* Free trial: can you test it for free before committing?  
* Ease-of-use: does it have a simple, intuitive setup that works for non-technical users?  
* In-person meeting support: can it transcribe audio from live recordings or uploaded files, not just virtual calls?  
* Security and privacy: how is customer data handled on the platform?  
* Integrations: can it connect with your existing stack, like HubSpot, Notion, or Slack?  
* Functionality: does it go beyond transcriptions and actually help you take action?  
* Languages: can it transcribe and summarize meetings in different languages?  
* Desktop and mobile apps: can you access it on Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android for on-the-go meetings?  
* Recordings: is there support for saving and playing back audio and video recordings of meetings?    
## Evaluating Granola and Otter.ai  
Granola:
- Pros: Minimal, user-friendly app with custom templates for tailored notes. Accurate transcription quality without needing a meeting bot.
- Cons: MacOS only with limited integrations, lacks multi-user features, and some basic capabilities due to being a new product.

Otter.ai:
- Pros: Easy to use with live editing, strong free plan, and seamless integration with Zoom & calendar for auto-recording meetings.
- Cons: Transcription errors with accents or fast speech, only supports English, and speaker ID can be unreliable, requiring manual corrections.

**Granola**: People or companies who prioritize ease of use and in-person meetings may find Granola appealing. However, its lack of integrations with popular tools like HubSpot and limited language support may hinder its usefulness in a professional setting.

**Otter.ai**: Users looking for Zoom and calendar integration, as well as mobile apps for on-the-go access, may opt for Otter.ai. Nevertheless, its shortcomings in local recording capabilities and depth of integrations with other platforms may limit its effectiveness in enhancing meeting productivity.
