# Granola vs. Otter.ai – Which should you choose?  
AI meeting notes platforms provide four primary deliverables:  
  
* Transcripts create a word-for-word record of the meeting. For example, a one-hour product development meeting generates a searchable document containing every feature discussion, technical requirement, and team decision.  
* Action items are pulled directly from the conversation. When someone says "John will update the wireframes by Friday," the AI automatically creates a tracked task with the assignee and deadline.  
* Meeting summaries distill hour-long conversations into 2-3 paragraphs. A 45-minute sprint planning meeting becomes a concise overview of sprint goals, resource allocation, and key decisions.  
* Topic segmentation breaks discussions into labeled sections. A client call covering multiple projects is automatically divided into sections like "Website Redesign," "Q1 Marketing Campaign," and "Budget Review."  
  
In addition to the quality of these deliverables, we'll want to look at a number of other key factors:  
  
* Free trial: can you test it for free before committing?  
* Ease-of-use: does it have a simple, intuitive setup that works for non-technical users?  
* In-person meeting support: can it transcribe audio from live recordings or uploaded files, not just virtual calls?  
* Security and privacy: how is customer data handled on the platform?  
* Integrations: can it connect with your existing stack, like HubSpot, Notion, or Slack?  
* Functionality: does it go beyond transcriptions and actually help you take action?  
* Languages: can it transcribe and summarize meetings in different languages?  
* Desktop and mobile apps: can you access it on Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android for on-the-go meetings?  
* Recordings: is there support for saving and playing back audio and video recordings of meetings?    
## Evaluating Granola and Otter.ai  
### Granola
* Granola operates as a background note-taking tool that produces organized summaries after meetings, with customizable templates and a minimalist interface similar to Apple Notes. The tool currently runs only on Mac with no mobile apps, requires system audio capture to function, and as a newer product has some minor feature gaps that are actively being addressed.

### Otter.ai
* Otter.ai provides real-time transcription with AI summaries of key themes, allows in-meeting highlighting and commenting, and includes a free tier for basic use. The tool can produce overly detailed transcripts that lack structure, struggles with complex audio quality, and has received criticism for aggressive calendar integration and free tier limitations.  
## Comparison table    
Small teams and freelancers who need basic recording and transcription might prefer Granola, especially if they work in multiple languages or want a simple desktop tool. The lack of integrations and automation won't matter much if they just need to capture and reference conversations occasionally.

Larger companies and sales teams would likely choose Otter.ai for its mobile apps and basic integrations with common tools, though they might find the automation features less useful than advertised. Its security features and in-person recording make it suitable for enterprise use, even if the platform doesn't deeply connect with their existing workflow tools.
