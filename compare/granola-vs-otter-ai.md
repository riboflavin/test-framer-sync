# Granola vs. Otter.ai – Which should you choose?  
AI meeting notes platforms provide four primary deliverables:  
  
* Transcripts create a word-for-word record of the meeting. For example, a one-hour product development meeting generates a searchable document containing every feature discussion, technical requirement, and team decision.  
* Action items are pulled directly from the conversation. When someone says "John will update the wireframes by Friday," the AI automatically creates a tracked task with the assignee and deadline.  
* Meeting summaries distill hour-long conversations into 2-3 paragraphs. A 45-minute sprint planning meeting becomes a concise overview of sprint goals, resource allocation, and key decisions.  
* Topic segmentation breaks discussions into labeled sections. A client call covering multiple projects is automatically divided into sections like "Website Redesign," "Q1 Marketing Campaign," and "Budget Review."  
  
In addition to the quality of these deliverables, we'll want to look at a number of other key factors:  
  
* Free trial: can you test it for free before committing?  
* Ease-of-use: does it have a simple, intuitive setup that works for non-technical users?  
* In-person meeting support: can it transcribe audio from live recordings or uploaded files, not just virtual calls?  
* Security and privacy: how is customer data handled on the platform?  
* Integrations: can it connect with your existing stack, like HubSpot, Notion, or Slack?  
* Functionality: does it go beyond transcriptions and actually help you take action?  
* Languages: can it transcribe and summarize meetings in different languages?  
* Desktop and mobile apps: can you access it on Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android for on-the-go meetings?  
* Recordings: is there support for saving and playing back audio and video recordings of meetings?    
## Evaluating Granola and Otter.ai  
### Granola
- Minimal, user-friendly app – feels like a regular notepad
- No meeting bot needed, works on any platform by listening on device (more discreet)
- Custom templates for notes yield tailored summaries
- Accurate transcription quality helps fill in details you miss

### Otter.ai

## Comparison table    
Some individuals or organizations may prefer Granola for its ease of use and compatibility with in-person meetings and local recording. However, both tools lack deep integrations with popular platforms like HubSpot and Notion, limiting their overall utility in enhancing productivity during meetings.

On the other hand, Otter.ai offers integration with Zoom and calendars, making it suitable for users who heavily rely on these tools for scheduling and communication. Nevertheless, its limited integrations and lack of an automation engine may hinder users looking for a comprehensive solution to streamline their meeting processes effectively.
