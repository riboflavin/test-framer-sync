# Zoom AI vs. Granola – Which should you choose?  
AI meeting notes platforms provide four primary deliverables:  
  
* Transcripts create a word-for-word record of the meeting. For example, a one-hour product development meeting generates a searchable document containing every feature discussion, technical requirement, and team decision.  
* Action items are pulled directly from the conversation. When someone says "John will update the wireframes by Friday," the AI automatically creates a tracked task with the assignee and deadline.  
* Meeting summaries distill hour-long conversations into 2-3 paragraphs. A 45-minute sprint planning meeting becomes a concise overview of sprint goals, resource allocation, and key decisions.  
* Topic segmentation breaks discussions into labeled sections. A client call covering multiple projects is automatically divided into sections like "Website Redesign," "Q1 Marketing Campaign," and "Budget Review."  
  
In addition to the quality of these deliverables, we'll want to look at a number of other key factors:  
  
* Free trial: can you test it for free before committing?  
* Ease-of-use: does it have a simple, intuitive setup that works for non-technical users?  
* In-person meeting support: can it transcribe audio from live recordings or uploaded files, not just virtual calls?  
* Security and privacy: how is customer data handled on the platform?  
* Integrations: can it connect with your existing stack, like HubSpot, Notion, or Slack?  
* Functionality: does it go beyond transcriptions and actually help you take action?  
* Languages: can it transcribe and summarize meetings in different languages?  
* Desktop and mobile apps: can you access it on Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android for on-the-go meetings?  
* Recordings: is there support for saving and playing back audio and video recordings of meetings?    
## Evaluating Zoom AI and Granola  
### Zoom AI
* Zoom AI integrates natively with Zoom meetings, providing real-time Q&A, whiteboard AI for diagrams, and meeting assistance with no additional setup or cost for paid Zoom subscribers. The system captures meeting content and enables AI interactions directly within Zoom Chat, making it seamless for existing Zoom users.
* The platform only works within Zoom's ecosystem, requiring a paid Zoom subscription and excluding other meeting platforms like Google Meet or Teams. The system has limitations around speaker identification for non-logged-in participants and lacks custom vocabulary options for specialized terminology.

### Granola
* Granola functions as a standalone note-taking app that works across meeting platforms by listening through the device, offering custom templates for summaries and high-quality transcription without requiring a meeting bot. The app maintains a simple notepad-style interface focused on individual note-taking functionality.
* The application currently only supports MacOS, with limited platform integrations and basic transcript editing capabilities. The tool lacks multi-user collaboration features, requiring manual note sharing, and continues to build out its feature set as a newer product.  
## Comparison table    
Zoom AI makes sense for companies already paying for Zoom who want basic meeting summaries and mainly do remote meetings. The tight Zoom integration and mobile apps are useful, but the lack of third-party integrations and automation limits its usefulness for teams who need to do anything with their meeting content.

Granola works better for individuals or small teams who do a mix of in-person and remote meetings and want a free option to start with. The ability to handle local recordings and in-person meetings is valuable, but the Mac-only limitation and missing integrations make it hard to fit into existing workflows.
