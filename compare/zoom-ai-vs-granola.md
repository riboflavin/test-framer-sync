# Zoom AI vs. Granola – Which should you choose?  
AI meeting notes platforms provide four primary deliverables:  
  
* Transcripts create a word-for-word record of the meeting. For example, a one-hour product development meeting generates a searchable document containing every feature discussion, technical requirement, and team decision.  
* Action items are pulled directly from the conversation. When someone says "John will update the wireframes by Friday," the AI automatically creates a tracked task with the assignee and deadline.  
* Meeting summaries distill hour-long conversations into 2-3 paragraphs. A 45-minute sprint planning meeting becomes a concise overview of sprint goals, resource allocation, and key decisions.  
* Topic segmentation breaks discussions into labeled sections. A client call covering multiple projects is automatically divided into sections like "Website Redesign," "Q1 Marketing Campaign," and "Budget Review."  
  
In addition to the quality of these deliverables, we'll want to look at a number of other key factors:  
  
* Free trial: can you test it for free before committing?  
* Ease-of-use: does it have a simple, intuitive setup that works for non-technical users?  
* In-person meeting support: can it transcribe audio from live recordings or uploaded files, not just virtual calls?  
* Security and privacy: how is customer data handled on the platform?  
* Integrations: can it connect with your existing stack, like HubSpot, Notion, or Slack?  
* Functionality: does it go beyond transcriptions and actually help you take action?  
* Languages: can it transcribe and summarize meetings in different languages?  
* Desktop and mobile apps: can you access it on Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android for on-the-go meetings?  
* Recordings: is there support for saving and playing back audio and video recordings of meetings?    
## Evaluating Zoom AI and Granola  
### Zoom AI
* Zoom AI integrates natively with Zoom meetings, providing real-time Q&A, whiteboard AI for diagrams, and meeting assistance with no additional setup or cost for paid Zoom subscribers. The system captures meeting content and enables AI interactions directly within Zoom Chat, making it seamless for existing Zoom users.
* The platform only works within Zoom meetings, requires a paid Zoom subscription, and cannot identify speakers who aren't logged in as Zoom users. The system lacks custom vocabulary options and is limited to Zoom's ecosystem, making it unsuitable for users of other meeting platforms.

### Granola
* Granola functions as a standalone note-taking app that works across meeting platforms by listening through the device, offering custom templates and transcription capabilities. The app operates independently of meeting software and doesn't require a meeting bot or special integrations.
* The application is currently limited to MacOS, lacks robust integrations with other tools, and doesn't support multi-user collaboration features. As a newer product, it has basic functionality in areas like transcript editing and feature development is ongoing.  
## Comparison table    
Zoom AI makes sense for companies already paying for Zoom who want basic meeting help without changing their workflow. The tight Zoom integration and mobile apps are useful for remote-first teams, though the tool lacks meaningful integrations with common workplace software.

Granola works better for people who do a mix of in-person and remote meetings, or those who want a free solution to start with. While it handles local recordings well and works on Mac, it's limited by its lack of mobile apps and calendar integration, making it less useful for teams who need those features.
