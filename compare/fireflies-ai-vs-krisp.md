# Fireflies.ai vs. Krisp – Which should you choose?  
AI meeting notes platforms provide four primary deliverables:  
  
* Transcripts create a word-for-word record of the meeting. For example, a one-hour product development meeting generates a searchable document containing every feature discussion, technical requirement, and team decision.  
* Action items are pulled directly from the conversation. When someone says "John will update the wireframes by Friday," the AI automatically creates a tracked task with the assignee and deadline.  
* Meeting summaries distill hour-long conversations into 2-3 paragraphs. A 45-minute sprint planning meeting becomes a concise overview of sprint goals, resource allocation, and key decisions.  
* Topic segmentation breaks discussions into labeled sections. A client call covering multiple projects is automatically divided into sections like "Website Redesign," "Q1 Marketing Campaign," and "Budget Review."  
  
In addition to the quality of these deliverables, we'll want to look at a number of other key factors:  
  
* Free trial: can you test it for free before committing?  
* Ease-of-use: does it have a simple, intuitive setup that works for non-technical users?  
* In-person meeting support: can it transcribe audio from live recordings or uploaded files, not just virtual calls?  
* Security and privacy: how is customer data handled on the platform?  
* Integrations: can it connect with your existing stack, like HubSpot, Notion, or Slack?  
* Functionality: does it go beyond transcriptions and actually help you take action?  
* Languages: can it transcribe and summarize meetings in different languages?  
* Desktop and mobile apps: can you access it on Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android for on-the-go meetings?  
* Recordings: is there support for saving and playing back audio and video recordings of meetings?    
## Evaluating Fireflies.ai and Krisp  
### Fireflies.ai
* Fireflies.ai integrates with major meeting platforms, provides detailed summaries with action items, and includes features like keyword tracking, sentiment analysis, and task assignments. Setup requires only inviting a bot to meetings, and transcription accuracy is around 90%, though it can struggle with accents and specialized terms.
* The free plan has restrictive limits on minutes and storage, pushing users toward paid tiers, and the interface can be complex to navigate due to feature density. Users receive automatic email notifications for every meeting, which can become overwhelming for those with many meetings.

### Krisp
* Krisp provides noise cancellation for both input and output audio across any meeting platform or phone call, with unlimited transcription on all plans and custom vocabulary options for industry terms. The free tier includes basic noise reduction and a limited number of daily summaries.
* Usage is capped at 60 minutes per day of noise removal and 2 summaries daily on the free plan, and summaries are brief compared to competitors. The tool lacks collaborative features for teams and can be resource-intensive during extended meetings.  
## Comparison table    
Fireflies.ai makes sense for remote sales teams and customer success managers who need basic meeting transcripts synced to their CRM and note-taking tools, though they'll likely need additional tools to turn those insights into real action. The web-based approach and calendar integration work well for distributed teams, but the lack of offline and in-person recording capabilities limits its usefulness.

Krisp is a better fit for individual professionals and small teams who record a mix of in-person and remote conversations, and don't need complex integrations with business tools. The desktop app and local recording are convenient for personal use, but the missing calendar and CRM connections mean users will spend more time manually organizing their recordings.
