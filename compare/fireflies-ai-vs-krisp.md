# Fireflies.ai vs. Krisp – Which should you choose?  
AI meeting notes platforms provide four primary deliverables:  
  
* Transcripts create a word-for-word record of the meeting. For example, a one-hour product development meeting generates a searchable document containing every feature discussion, technical requirement, and team decision.  
* Action items are pulled directly from the conversation. When someone says "John will update the wireframes by Friday," the AI automatically creates a tracked task with the assignee and deadline.  
* Meeting summaries distill hour-long conversations into 2-3 paragraphs. A 45-minute sprint planning meeting becomes a concise overview of sprint goals, resource allocation, and key decisions.  
* Topic segmentation breaks discussions into labeled sections. A client call covering multiple projects is automatically divided into sections like "Website Redesign," "Q1 Marketing Campaign," and "Budget Review."  
  
In addition to the quality of these deliverables, we'll want to look at a number of other key factors:  
  
* Free trial: can you test it for free before committing?  
* Ease-of-use: does it have a simple, intuitive setup that works for non-technical users?  
* In-person meeting support: can it transcribe audio from live recordings or uploaded files, not just virtual calls?  
* Security and privacy: how is customer data handled on the platform?  
* Integrations: can it connect with your existing stack, like HubSpot, Notion, or Slack?  
* Functionality: does it go beyond transcriptions and actually help you take action?  
* Languages: can it transcribe and summarize meetings in different languages?  
* Desktop and mobile apps: can you access it on Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android for on-the-go meetings?  
* Recordings: is there support for saving and playing back audio and video recordings of meetings?    
## Evaluating Fireflies.ai and Krisp  
### Fireflies.ai
* Fireflies.ai transcribes meetings, generates summaries and action items, and integrates with project management tools and CRMs across multiple platforms with a mobile app and free tier. The service struggles with accent recognition, technical terms, and speaker identification, while the free plan restricts key features like video recording.

### Krisp
* Krisp removes background noise during calls and provides AI note-taking with summaries and action items, with simple toggle controls. The service can distort voices when canceling loud noises, uses significant CPU resources, limits free noise cancellation to 60 minutes daily, and some users find the Pro version expensive.  
## Comparison table    
Fireflies.ai works best for mobile-first teams who need to record and transcribe meetings on the go, though its limited integrations mean you'll still need to do most of the follow-up work manually. The lack of a desktop app makes it less appealing for companies with strict IT policies, but its broad language support helps global teams collaborate.

Krisp is better suited for desktop-bound professionals and companies that need local recording capabilities with strong security features, despite having a basic integration set that doesn't help much with post-meeting workflows. Its desktop-only approach and missing mobile apps make it less flexible for remote teams, but it handles in-person meetings well.
