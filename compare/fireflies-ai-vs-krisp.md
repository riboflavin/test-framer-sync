# Fireflies.ai vs. Krisp: Which should you choose?
AI meeting notes platforms provide four primary deliverables:

• Transcripts create a word-for-word record of the meeting. For example, a one-hour product development meeting generates a searchable document containing every feature discussion, technical requirement, and team decision.
• Action items are pulled directly from the conversation. When someone says "John will update the wireframes by Friday," the AI automatically creates a tracked task with the assignee and deadline.
• Meeting summaries distill hour-long conversations into 2-3 paragraphs. A 45-minute sprint planning meeting becomes a concise overview of sprint goals, resource allocation, and key decisions.
• Topic segmentation breaks discussions into labeled sections. A client call covering multiple projects is automatically divided into sections like "Website Redesign," "Q1 Marketing Campaign," and "Budget Review."

In addition to the quality of these deliverables, we'll want to look at a number of other key factors:

• Free trial: can you test it for free before committing?
• Ease-of-use: does it have a simple, intuitive setup that works for non-technical users?
• In-person meeting support: can it transcribe audio from live recordings or uploaded files, not just virtual calls?
• Security and privacy: how is customer data handled on the platform?
• Integrations: can it connect with your existing stack, like HubSpot, Notion, or Slack?
• Functionality: does it go beyond transcriptions and actually help you take action?
• Languages: can it transcribe and summarize meetings in different languages?
• Desktop and mobile apps: can you access it on Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android for on-the-go meeitngs?
• Recordings: is there support for saving and playing back audio and video recordings of meetings?
## Evaluating Fireflies.ai and Krisp
Fireflies.ai offers wide compatibility with popular meeting platforms and provides detailed summaries and action items after each meeting. It is feature-rich with capabilities such as keywords, sentiment analysis, and task assignments. However, users have noted limitations with the free plan, transcription accuracy issues, a cluttered UI, and excessive email notifications.

Krisp excels in noise cancellation for both microphone and speaker audio, and is platform-agnostic, working with any meeting software. It offers unlimited transcription on all plans and a generous free plan with noise reduction and daily summaries. However, users have mentioned restrictions on the free plan, less detailed summaries compared to competitors, and the lack of real-time collaboration features.

.
- UI can feel cluttered due to many features, slight learning curve​reddit.com

Fireflies.ai may appeal to individuals or companies looking for a tool with Zoom and calendar integration, as well as the ability to integrate with platforms like HubSpot and Notion. However, it falls short in supporting in-person meetings and local recording, which may limit its usefulness in certain scenarios.

On the other hand, Krisp could be suitable for users seeking a straightforward and easy-to-use tool for virtual meetings, especially those who prioritize local recording capabilities. Nevertheless, its lack of deep integrations with popular platforms and absence of an automation engine may hinder its ability to truly enhance the user's meeting experience and productivity.
