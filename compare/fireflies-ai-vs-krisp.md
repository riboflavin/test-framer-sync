# Fireflies.ai vs. Krisp – Which should you choose?  
AI meeting notes platforms provide four primary deliverables:  
  
* Transcripts create a word-for-word record of the meeting. For example, a one-hour product development meeting generates a searchable document containing every feature discussion, technical requirement, and team decision.  
* Action items are pulled directly from the conversation. When someone says "John will update the wireframes by Friday," the AI automatically creates a tracked task with the assignee and deadline.  
* Meeting summaries distill hour-long conversations into 2-3 paragraphs. A 45-minute sprint planning meeting becomes a concise overview of sprint goals, resource allocation, and key decisions.  
* Topic segmentation breaks discussions into labeled sections. A client call covering multiple projects is automatically divided into sections like "Website Redesign," "Q1 Marketing Campaign," and "Budget Review."  
  
In addition to the quality of these deliverables, we'll want to look at a number of other key factors:  
  
* Free trial: can you test it for free before committing?  
* Ease-of-use: does it have a simple, intuitive setup that works for non-technical users?  
* In-person meeting support: can it transcribe audio from live recordings or uploaded files, not just virtual calls?  
* Security and privacy: how is customer data handled on the platform?  
* Integrations: can it connect with your existing stack, like HubSpot, Notion, or Slack?  
* Functionality: does it go beyond transcriptions and actually help you take action?  
* Languages: can it transcribe and summarize meetings in different languages?  
* Desktop and mobile apps: can you access it on Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android for on-the-go meetings?  
* Recordings: is there support for saving and playing back audio and video recordings of meetings?    
## Evaluating Fireflies.ai and Krisp  
### Fireflies.ai
* Fireflies.ai integrates with major meeting platforms, provides detailed summaries with action items, and includes features for keyword tracking, sentiment analysis, and task assignment. Setup requires only inviting a bot to meetings, but the free tier has limited minutes and storage, transcription accuracy varies with accents, and the interface requires some learning due to feature density.

### Krisp
* Krisp offers noise cancellation for audio input/output across any meeting platform or phone calls, includes unlimited transcription on all plans, and allows custom vocabulary for improved accuracy. The tool has CPU overhead during meetings, provides basic summaries without collaboration features, and limits free users to 60 minutes of noise removal and 2 summaries daily.  
## Comparison table    
Fireflies.ai makes sense for remote sales teams and customer success managers who need basic meeting transcripts synced to their CRM and note-taking tools, though the integration depth leaves much to be desired. The web-based approach and calendar sync work fine for video calls, but the lack of desktop software means you can't use it for in-person meetings or local recordings.

Krisp is better suited for podcasters, journalists, and anyone who needs to record in-person conversations or local audio with decent quality and noise cancellation. The desktop app is straightforward but lacks meaningful integrations with productivity tools, and there's no real workflow automation to help you actually do anything with the recordings.
