# Krisp vs. Avoma – Which should you choose?  
AI meeting notes platforms provide four primary deliverables:  
  
* Transcripts create a word-for-word record of the meeting. For example, a one-hour product development meeting generates a searchable document containing every feature discussion, technical requirement, and team decision.  
* Action items are pulled directly from the conversation. When someone says "John will update the wireframes by Friday," the AI automatically creates a tracked task with the assignee and deadline.  
* Meeting summaries distill hour-long conversations into 2-3 paragraphs. A 45-minute sprint planning meeting becomes a concise overview of sprint goals, resource allocation, and key decisions.  
* Topic segmentation breaks discussions into labeled sections. A client call covering multiple projects is automatically divided into sections like "Website Redesign," "Q1 Marketing Campaign," and "Budget Review."  
  
In addition to the quality of these deliverables, we'll want to look at a number of other key factors:  
  
* Free trial: can you test it for free before committing?  
* Ease-of-use: does it have a simple, intuitive setup that works for non-technical users?  
* In-person meeting support: can it transcribe audio from live recordings or uploaded files, not just virtual calls?  
* Security and privacy: how is customer data handled on the platform?  
* Integrations: can it connect with your existing stack, like HubSpot, Notion, or Slack?  
* Functionality: does it go beyond transcriptions and actually help you take action?  
* Languages: can it transcribe and summarize meetings in different languages?  
* Desktop and mobile apps: can you access it on Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android for on-the-go meetings?  
* Recordings: is there support for saving and playing back audio and video recordings of meetings?    
## Evaluating Krisp and Avoma  
### Krisp
* Krisp provides noise cancellation for all audio sources and unlimited transcription with custom vocabulary support, working across any meeting platform or phone calls. The tool operates independently for each user without team features, and includes a free tier with daily usage limits for noise reduction and summaries.
* System performance can be impacted during extended meetings due to AI processing load, and summaries focus on brevity rather than detail. Free tier restricts noise cancellation to 60 minutes daily and allows only two summaries per day.

### Avoma
* Avoma delivers transcription with speaker identification and integrates with business tools like CRMs and calendars for workflow automation. The platform includes AI-generated summaries and meeting highlights for review purposes.
* The service requires a paid subscription starting around $59-79 per user monthly, has no permanent free tier, and presents an initial learning curve for new users. Technical issues include occasional delayed meeting joins and missed speaker identification.  
## Comparison table    
Krisp makes sense for individuals and small teams who need a simple recording tool that works across different languages and meeting types, including in-person conversations. The desktop app and mobile options make it easy to capture audio anywhere, though you'll need other tools to do much with the recordings afterward.

Avoma fits larger sales teams and companies who live in Zoom and need their meeting content synced to tools like HubSpot, despite being English-only and web-based. The automation capabilities and calendar integration are useful for managing lots of meetings, but the platform requires investment in learning and doesn't handle offline or in-person scenarios well.
