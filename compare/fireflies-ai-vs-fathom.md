# Fireflies.ai vs. Fathom – Which should you choose?  
AI meeting notes platforms provide four primary deliverables:  
  
* Transcripts create a word-for-word record of the meeting. For example, a one-hour product development meeting generates a searchable document containing every feature discussion, technical requirement, and team decision.  
* Action items are pulled directly from the conversation. When someone says "John will update the wireframes by Friday," the AI automatically creates a tracked task with the assignee and deadline.  
* Meeting summaries distill hour-long conversations into 2-3 paragraphs. A 45-minute sprint planning meeting becomes a concise overview of sprint goals, resource allocation, and key decisions.  
* Topic segmentation breaks discussions into labeled sections. A client call covering multiple projects is automatically divided into sections like "Website Redesign," "Q1 Marketing Campaign," and "Budget Review."  
  
In addition to the quality of these deliverables, we'll want to look at a number of other key factors:  
  
* Free trial: can you test it for free before committing?  
* Ease-of-use: does it have a simple, intuitive setup that works for non-technical users?  
* In-person meeting support: can it transcribe audio from live recordings or uploaded files, not just virtual calls?  
* Security and privacy: how is customer data handled on the platform?  
* Integrations: can it connect with your existing stack, like HubSpot, Notion, or Slack?  
* Functionality: does it go beyond transcriptions and actually help you take action?  
* Languages: can it transcribe and summarize meetings in different languages?  
* Desktop and mobile apps: can you access it on Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android for on-the-go meetings?  
* Recordings: is there support for saving and playing back audio and video recordings of meetings?    
## Evaluating Fireflies.ai and Fathom  
### Fireflies.ai
* Fireflies.ai integrates with major meeting platforms and provides detailed summaries, action items, sentiment analysis, and task assignments through a bot-based system that requires minimal setup. The service has usage limits on free plans, sends frequent email notifications, shows occasional transcription errors with accents, and presents a somewhat complex interface due to its feature density.

### Fathom
* Fathom delivers accurate transcripts across languages, generates meeting summaries, and offers unlimited usage of core features at no cost. The platform has historically been Zoom-focused with limited platform support, can produce duplicate notes with multiple users, and requires paid plans for advanced features while lacking real-time collaborative editing.  
## Comparison table    
Fireflies.ai seems built for sales teams and companies that need to process lots of calls efficiently, with its automation features making it easier to handle high meeting volumes despite limited integration depth. The tool works well enough for basic meeting recording and transcription, but falls short when trying to turn meetings into meaningful action items or deeper CRM workflows.

Fathom appears designed for individual professionals and small teams who want simple meeting recording without much complexity, offering a generous free tier that makes it accessible to most users. While it handles the basics of meeting capture competently, it lacks both automation capabilities and the kind of deep integrations that would help users actually accomplish more with their meeting content.
