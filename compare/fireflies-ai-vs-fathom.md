# Fireflies.ai vs. Fathom: Which should you choose?
AI meeting notes platforms provide four primary deliverables:

• Transcripts create a word-for-word record of the meeting. For example, a one-hour product development meeting generates a searchable document containing every feature discussion, technical requirement, and team decision.
• Action items are pulled directly from the conversation. When someone says "John will update the wireframes by Friday," the AI automatically creates a tracked task with the assignee and deadline.
• Meeting summaries distill hour-long conversations into 2-3 paragraphs. A 45-minute sprint planning meeting becomes a concise overview of sprint goals, resource allocation, and key decisions.
• Topic segmentation breaks discussions into labeled sections. A client call covering multiple projects is automatically divided into sections like "Website Redesign," "Q1 Marketing Campaign," and "Budget Review."

In addition to the quality of these deliverables, we'll want to look at a number of other key factors:

• Free trial: can you test it for free before committing?
• Ease-of-use: does it have a simple, intuitive setup that works for non-technical users?
• In-person meeting support: can it transcribe audio from live recordings or uploaded files, not just virtual calls?
• Security and privacy: how is customer data handled on the platform?
• Integrations: can it connect with your existing stack, like HubSpot, Notion, or Slack?
• Functionality: does it go beyond transcriptions and actually help you take action?
• Languages: can it transcribe and summarize meetings in different languages?
• Desktop and mobile apps: can you access it on Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android for on-the-go meeitngs?
• Recordings: is there support for saving and playing back audio and video recordings of meetings?
## Evaluating Fireflies.ai and Fathom
Fireflies.ai offers wide compatibility with various platforms, detailed meeting summaries, and feature-rich insights, but users may encounter limitations with the free plan, transcription accuracy, cluttered UI, and excessive email notifications. On the other hand, Fathom excels in transcript accuracy, provides quick summaries, offers free unlimited core features, and supports multiple languages. However, users note historical Zoom-only support, occasional duplicate note issues, limited live collaboration capabilities, and the need for a paid plan for advanced features.

Fireflies.ai might appeal to individuals or companies looking for a tool with Zoom and calendar integration, as well as integration with platforms like HubSpot and Notion. However, its lack of in-person meeting support and local recording capabilities may limit its usefulness for those seeking a more comprehensive solution for their meetings.

Fathom, on the other hand, offers a free unlimited plan and is very easy to use, making it attractive to users who prioritize simplicity and cost-effectiveness. Despite its integration with various languages and availability on both iPhone and Android, its lack of an automation engine and limited integrations may hinder its ability to truly streamline meeting processes for users.
