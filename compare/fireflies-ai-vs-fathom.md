# Fireflies.ai vs. Fathom: Which should you choose?
AI meeting notes platforms provide four primary deliverables:  
  
* Transcripts create a word-for-word record of the meeting. For example, a one-hour product development meeting generates a searchable document containing every feature discussion, technical requirement, and team decision.  
* Action items are pulled directly from the conversation. When someone says "John will update the wireframes by Friday," the AI automatically creates a tracked task with the assignee and deadline.  
* Meeting summaries distill hour-long conversations into 2-3 paragraphs. A 45-minute sprint planning meeting becomes a concise overview of sprint goals, resource allocation, and key decisions.  
* Topic segmentation breaks discussions into labeled sections. A client call covering multiple projects is automatically divided into sections like "Website Redesign," "Q1 Marketing Campaign," and "Budget Review."  
  
In addition to the quality of these deliverables, we'll want to look at a number of other key factors:  
  
* Free trial: can you test it for free before committing?  
* Ease-of-use: does it have a simple, intuitive setup that works for non-technical users?  
* In-person meeting support: can it transcribe audio from live recordings or uploaded files, not just virtual calls?  
* Security and privacy: how is customer data handled on the platform?  
* Integrations: can it connect with your existing stack, like HubSpot, Notion, or Slack?
• Functionality: does it go beyond transcriptions and actually help you take action?
• Languages: can it transcribe and summarize meetings in different languages?
• Desktop and mobile apps: can you access it on Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android for on-the-go meeitngs?
• Recordings: is there support for saving and playing back audio and video recordings of meetings?
## Evaluating Fireflies.ai and Fathom
- Fireflies.ai: Wide compatibility with various platforms, detailed summaries and action items emailed post-meeting, feature-rich for deeper insights, easy setup; but limited free plan, transcription accuracy issues, cluttered UI, and excessive email notifications.
- Fathom: Top-notch accuracy in transcripts, quick high-quality summaries, free unlimited core features usage, supports multiple languages; however, historically Zoom-only, potential duplicate note issues, lacks live collaboration, and advanced features require a paid plan.

- Fireflies.ai might appeal to individuals or businesses looking for a tool with basic integrations like Zoom and Calendar, as well as support for multiple languages. However, its lack of in-person meeting capabilities and local recording options may limit its usefulness in certain scenarios.

- Fathom, on the other hand, could be attractive to users seeking a straightforward solution with a free unlimited plan and very easy usability. Despite its integration with popular platforms like HubSpot and Notion, the absence of an automation engine might hinder its ability to truly streamline meeting processes and tasks.
