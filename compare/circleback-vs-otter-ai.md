# Circleback vs. Otter.ai – Which should you choose?  
AI meeting notes platforms provide four primary deliverables:  
  
* Transcripts create a word-for-word record of the meeting. For example, a one-hour product development meeting generates a searchable document containing every feature discussion, technical requirement, and team decision.  
* Action items are pulled directly from the conversation. When someone says "John will update the wireframes by Friday," the AI automatically creates a tracked task with the assignee and deadline.  
* Meeting summaries distill hour-long conversations into 2-3 paragraphs. A 45-minute sprint planning meeting becomes a concise overview of sprint goals, resource allocation, and key decisions.  
* Topic segmentation breaks discussions into labeled sections. A client call covering multiple projects is automatically divided into sections like "Website Redesign," "Q1 Marketing Campaign," and "Budget Review."  
  
In addition to the quality of these deliverables, we'll want to look at a number of other key factors:  
  
* Free trial: can you test it for free before committing?  
* Ease-of-use: does it have a simple, intuitive setup that works for non-technical users?  
* In-person meeting support: can it transcribe audio from live recordings or uploaded files, not just virtual calls?  
* Security and privacy: how is customer data handled on the platform?  
* Integrations: can it connect with your existing stack, like HubSpot, Notion, or Slack?  
* Functionality: does it go beyond transcriptions and actually help you take action?  
* Languages: can it transcribe and summarize meetings in different languages?  
* Desktop and mobile apps: can you access it on Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android for on-the-go meetings?  
* Recordings: is there support for saving and playing back audio and video recordings of meetings?    
## Evaluating Circleback and Otter.ai  
### Circleback
* Circleback creates meeting notes within minutes of calls ending and integrates with calendars, Slack and CRM systems. The tool generates summaries with action items and key points, though it lacks video recording capabilities and is newer to market with a more limited feature set.

### Otter.ai
* Otter.ai provides real-time transcription with commenting features and generates AI summaries of meetings, offering a free tier and time-saving note creation. The tool produces verbose transcripts that can be hard to parse, has accuracy issues with complex audio, and requires careful configuration to avoid unwanted calendar behavior and meeting joins.  
## Comparison table    
Small teams and freelancers who need basic meeting tools will find Otter useful for quick transcriptions and simple note-taking. While it offers some integrations, the cloud-only approach and limited language support make it most suitable for English-speaking users who don't mind working entirely online.

Larger organizations and companies with security requirements will likely prefer Circleback's more comprehensive feature set and desktop application. Though both platforms could improve their integration depth, Circleback's local recording and broader language support make it more practical for international teams and those handling sensitive information.
