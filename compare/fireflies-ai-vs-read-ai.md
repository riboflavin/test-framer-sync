# Fireflies.ai vs. Read.ai – Which should you choose?  
AI meeting notes platforms provide four primary deliverables:  
  
* Transcripts create a word-for-word record of the meeting. For example, a one-hour product development meeting generates a searchable document containing every feature discussion, technical requirement, and team decision.  
* Action items are pulled directly from the conversation. When someone says "John will update the wireframes by Friday," the AI automatically creates a tracked task with the assignee and deadline.  
* Meeting summaries distill hour-long conversations into 2-3 paragraphs. A 45-minute sprint planning meeting becomes a concise overview of sprint goals, resource allocation, and key decisions.  
* Topic segmentation breaks discussions into labeled sections. A client call covering multiple projects is automatically divided into sections like "Website Redesign," "Q1 Marketing Campaign," and "Budget Review."  
  
In addition to the quality of these deliverables, we'll want to look at a number of other key factors:  
  
* Free trial: can you test it for free before committing?  
* Ease-of-use: does it have a simple, intuitive setup that works for non-technical users?  
* In-person meeting support: can it transcribe audio from live recordings or uploaded files, not just virtual calls?  
* Security and privacy: how is customer data handled on the platform?  
* Integrations: can it connect with your existing stack, like HubSpot, Notion, or Slack?  
* Functionality: does it go beyond transcriptions and actually help you take action?  
* Languages: can it transcribe and summarize meetings in different languages?  
* Desktop and mobile apps: can you access it on Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android for on-the-go meetings?  
* Recordings: is there support for saving and playing back audio and video recordings of meetings?    
## Evaluating Fireflies.ai and Read.ai  
### Fireflies.ai
* Fireflies offers transcription in multiple languages, meeting summaries with action items, mobile app access, and integrations with project management tools and CRMs, with a free tier available. Some accuracy issues occur with accents and technical terms, interface can be cluttered, and advanced features like video recording require paid plans.

### Read.ai
* Read provides meeting quality analytics, smart summaries, real-time translation across 16+ languages, and integrations with Slack, Notion, and Confluence. Free tier limits users to 5 meetings monthly, interface can be complex to navigate, and enterprise pricing is higher than competitors, while privacy concerns exist around unauthorized meeting access.  
## Comparison table    
Fireflies.ai seems best suited for mobile-first teams and salespeople who need to capture meetings on the go, though its limited integrations mean you'll still need other tools to act on what you learn. The mobile app gives it an edge for field work, but the lack of a proper desktop experience and automation tools makes it feel incomplete.

Read.ai works well for desk-bound teams who don't need mobile access and want a simpler tool focused on core meeting capture, though like its competitor it doesn't go far enough in helping users take action on meeting outcomes. Its clean approach matches well with traditional office environments, but the missing mobile support and automation capabilities leave room for improvement.
