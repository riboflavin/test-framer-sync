# Notion Meeting Recorder vs Granola for meeting automation

## Notion Meeting Recorder

Notion Meeting Recorder captures meetings directly within your Notion workspace using your device's microphone or system audio. It transcribes the audio and generates an organized summary with key points and action items as the meeting ends. The feature works with both virtual meetings (Zoom, Teams, etc.) and in-person conversations, storing everything as searchable Notion pages where they can be linked to projects or converted to tasks. Users access it via a /meet command or through calendar events in Notion.

The recorder is available on desktop apps (Mac and Windows), web browsers, and mobile apps, supporting 16 languages for transcription. It's part of the Notion AI add-on ($10/member/month or $8/member/month annually) which can be added to any Notion plan. The tool works best for teams already using Notion extensively, as it doesn't have standalone functionality outside the Notion ecosystem and relies on your device properly capturing audio.

Granola is an AI notepad for meetings that runs on Mac computers. It captures audio from any meeting platform (Zoom, Teams, Webex) without requiring a bot in the call. Users take minimal notes during meetings, and Granola produces structured summaries with key takeaways and next steps when the meeting ends. It offers customizable templates for different meeting types and an AI assistant that can answer questions or generate follow-up content.

The tool works offline, recording and transcribing locally on Mac, and supports approximately 16 languages. Pricing starts with 25 free meetings, followed by an $18/month individual plan for unlimited meetings, $14/user/month for business teams, and $35/user/month for enterprise. Limitations include Mac-only support (no Windows version yet), no mobile apps, and limited integrations (calendar sync and Notion export are available, with HubSpot integration in beta).

## Comparing Notion Meeting Recorder and Granola

* ### Notion Meeting Recorder
  * Notion Meeting Recorder captures meetings directly within Notion, producing transcripts and summaries with key points and action items. It functions within the existing Notion ecosystem, making it convenient for teams already using the platform but potentially requiring configuration to maximize benefits.

* ### Granola
  * Granola is a standalone Mac application that records meetings without needing a call bot, allowing users to focus on conversations while it generates structured meeting notes. While offering a simple interface and customizable templates, it has limited platform availability and fewer integration options compared to more established tools.

Notion Meeting Recorder is best suited for organizations already embedded in the Notion ecosystem who want meeting documentation directly integrated with their existing workflows. Teams can immediately convert notes into tasks and projects within Notion, though the value diminishes significantly for those not using Notion as their primary workspace. Users get a comprehensive solution but remain limited to Notion's boundaries.

Granola appeals to individual professionals seeking a dedicated, standalone meeting documentation tool with minimal distractions. Its strength lies in simplicity and focus rather than broad integration capability. Mac-only users who attend many meetings but don't need complex integrations will appreciate Granola's approach, though they'll face limitations when attempting to connect their meeting insights with broader workflows or when working across different devices.

## Notion Meeting Recorder vs Granola: What do users say?

Notion Meeting Recorder and Granola are AI-powered meeting note-taking tools that have received attention for their ability to streamline the meeting documentation process. Notion's Meeting Recorder works directly within the Notion ecosystem, capturing audio from meetings (virtual or in-person) and automatically generating transcripts, summaries, and action items. Users appreciate that it eliminates context switching by keeping notes within their Notion workspace, though some note it works best for teams already invested in the Notion ecosystem. The service is available as part of Notion's AI add-on ($10/month per user, or $8/month when billed annually). Meanwhile, Granola operates as a standalone Mac application with a clean, simple interface that captures system audio from any meeting platform. Users highlight its "set and forget" functionality that allows them to focus on conversations while still getting quality notes afterward. Granola offers 25 free meeting credits before requiring a subscription ($18/month for individuals, $14/user/month for business teams). Both tools support multiple languages and can record in-person meetings, though Granola currently lacks Windows and mobile support.

## FAQs 
• Would Notion Meeting Recorder work for in-person meetings? What about Granola?
Yes, Notion Meeting Recorder works for in-person meetings as it can "capture in-person discussions using your device's microphone" and works "with every meeting tool—including face-to-face meetings." For Granola, it's partially supported—the Mac app can capture in-room audio locally, but there's no mobile app yet (Android/iOS are "coming soon").

• What about meeting bots? Does either of these tools require a meeting bot?
Neither tool requires a meeting bot. Notion Meeting Recorder "doesn't have a live 'bot' joining calls – it relies on your device's audio" and uses a "local recording approach (rather than inserting a bot participant)." Similarly, Granola "listens to meetings without needing a bot in the call" and works "discreetly with no meeting intrusion."

• What do users say about the quality of transcriptions?
The context doesn't provide specific user comments about the quality of transcriptions for either tool. The context mentions that early Notion users report "Notion's AI does a good job extracting key points from dense conversations," but doesn't directly address transcription quality. For Granola, the context mentions users love the "set and forget" note-taking and that it delivers "well-organized summaries," but doesn't specifically comment on transcription quality.
