# Notion Meeting Recorder vs Zoom AI for meeting automation

## Notion Meeting Recorder

Notion Meeting Recorder captures meetings directly within Notion workspaces by recording audio from devices and generating transcripts with structured summaries and action items. It works for both virtual and in-person meetings, activates via a /meet command or calendar link, and stores all content in searchable Notion pages. The tool operates across 16 languages and functions on desktop and mobile apps, capturing audio locally without requiring meeting bots.

The recorder exists within Notion's ecosystem, meaning it integrates with Notion databases and pages but lacks built-in connections to external platforms like HubSpot. It requires the Notion AI add-on ($10 per user monthly or $8 annually) on top of any Notion plan. While it works with any meeting platform by capturing system audio, its usefulness depends on teams already using Notion for task management and documentation.

Zoom AI is an integrated feature set built directly into Zoom's platform for paid subscribers. It provides automatic meeting summaries and action items at the end of calls, allows participants to ask questions during meetings to catch up on missed content, and assists with composing related communications. The functionality works exclusively within Zoom's ecosystem, requiring no additional setup for existing users.

The tool operates only for virtual Zoom meetings and cannot capture in-person conversations. While it includes transcription support for over 30 languages, its integration capabilities are limited to Zoom's own ecosystem with few connections to external platforms. Zoom AI offers minimal workflow automation beyond basic summaries and Q&A, and is included at no additional cost for users on Zoom's paid plans.

## Comparing Notion Meeting Recorder and Zoom AI

### Notion Meeting Recorder

* Notion Meeting Recorder transcribes and summarizes meetings within the Notion workspace, capturing both virtual and in-person discussions using local device audio. It lacks robust integrations outside Notion and requires users to manually implement action items.

* The recorder is part of the Notion AI add-on ($10/user/month) and works best for teams already using Notion extensively. Despite strong organization capabilities, its value diminishes significantly for non-Notion users and offers limited automation beyond basic summaries.

### Zoom AI

* Zoom AI provides built-in meeting summaries and action items exclusively for Zoom calls, with live question-answering during meetings. It offers minimal integrations outside Zoom's ecosystem and limited workflow automation beyond basic meeting insights.

* The tool comes included with paid Zoom plans but doesn't work for in-person meetings or other platforms. While convenient for existing Zoom users, its utility is constrained by platform limitations and lacks meaningful connections to external productivity tools.

Notion Meeting Recorder works best for teams already embedded in the Notion ecosystem who need to capture meetings across different platforms and in-person discussions. Its strength lies in keeping everything within Notion's organizational structure, making it valuable for teams using Notion for project management and documentation.

Zoom AI suits organizations heavily invested in Zoom with minimal needs for external integrations. It's the simplest solution for teams that conduct most business through Zoom and need basic summaries without additional tools. Both solutions ultimately fall short in helping users truly action meeting outputs through their limited integration capabilities.

## Notion Meeting Recorder vs Zoom AI: What do users say?

Notion Meeting Recorder and Zoom AI offer contrasting approaches to meeting documentation. Notion's solution integrates directly within their workspace platform, allowing users to record meetings (both virtual and in-person) and generate AI-powered transcripts, summaries, and action items that live natively in Notion pages. Users appreciate its seamless integration with Notion's ecosystem, time-saving capabilities, and effective extraction of key points from conversations. However, critics note it works best for teams already committed to Notion, has a learning curve, and requires a paid add-on ($10/user/month or $8/user/month annually). In contrast, Zoom AI is built directly into Zoom's platform, enabling automatic meeting summaries, live AI Q&A during calls, and assistance with meeting-related communications. Zoom users value its frictionless integration, ease of use, instant summaries, and inclusion at no extra cost with paid Zoom accounts. Downsides include its limitation to the Zoom platform, unavailability to free users, and some features still being relatively basic compared to dedicated tools. While Notion can record in-person meetings through device microphones and supports 16 languages, Zoom AI only works for virtual Zoom calls but supports over 30 languages.

## FAQs 
• Would Notion Meeting Recorder work for in-person meetings? What about Zoom AI?
Yes, Notion Meeting Recorder works for in-person meetings. It can capture in-person discussions using your device's microphone and doesn't require a meeting bot. You could set your phone or laptop in a conference room to transcribe the conversation. Notion even has a mobile app to record meetings on the go.

Zoom AI does not work for in-person meetings. It only works for virtual Zoom calls and cannot independently capture in-person audio.

• What about meeting bots? Does either of these tools require a meeting bot?
Notion Meeting Recorder doesn't require a meeting bot. Unlike some dedicated meeting tools, it doesn't have a live "bot" joining calls – it relies on your device's audio. It records audio locally from your computer.

The context doesn't specifically mention whether Zoom AI requires a meeting bot, but it indicates that the AI works within the Zoom app itself rather than joining as a separate participant.

• What do users say about the quality of transcriptions?
The context doesn't provide specific user feedback about the quality of transcriptions for either tool. For Notion, users report that the AI "does a good job extracting key points from dense conversations" but this refers to the summarization rather than transcription quality specifically. For Zoom AI, there's no mention of transcription quality in the provided context.
