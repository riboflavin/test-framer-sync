# Zoom AI vs. Fireflies.ai – Which should you choose?  
AI meeting notes platforms provide four primary deliverables:  
  
* Transcripts create a word-for-word record of the meeting. For example, a one-hour product development meeting generates a searchable document containing every feature discussion, technical requirement, and team decision.  
* Action items are pulled directly from the conversation. When someone says "John will update the wireframes by Friday," the AI automatically creates a tracked task with the assignee and deadline.  
* Meeting summaries distill hour-long conversations into 2-3 paragraphs. A 45-minute sprint planning meeting becomes a concise overview of sprint goals, resource allocation, and key decisions.  
* Topic segmentation breaks discussions into labeled sections. A client call covering multiple projects is automatically divided into sections like "Website Redesign," "Q1 Marketing Campaign," and "Budget Review."  
  
In addition to the quality of these deliverables, we'll want to look at a number of other key factors:  
  
* Free trial: can you test it for free before committing?  
* Ease-of-use: does it have a simple, intuitive setup that works for non-technical users?  
* In-person meeting support: can it transcribe audio from live recordings or uploaded files, not just virtual calls?  
* Security and privacy: how is customer data handled on the platform?  
* Integrations: can it connect with your existing stack, like HubSpot, Notion, or Slack?  
* Functionality: does it go beyond transcriptions and actually help you take action?  
* Languages: can it transcribe and summarize meetings in different languages?  
* Desktop and mobile apps: can you access it on Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android for on-the-go meetings?  
* Recordings: is there support for saving and playing back audio and video recordings of meetings?    
## Evaluating Zoom AI and Fireflies.ai  
### Zoom AI
* Zoom AI integrates directly into Zoom meetings with real-time Q&A, whiteboard AI for diagrams, and outputs in Zoom Chat, requiring no additional setup for existing Zoom subscribers. The system has limitations including Zoom-only platform compatibility, requires a paid Zoom plan, won't capture non-logged-in speakers, and lacks custom vocabulary for industry terms.

### Fireflies.ai
* Fireflies.ai works across multiple meeting platforms, provides post-meeting summaries with action items, and includes features for keyword tracking and task assignment through a simple bot invitation process. The service has restricted free plan limits, 90% transcription accuracy, a feature-heavy interface that takes time to learn, and sends frequent meeting notification emails by default.  
## Comparison table    
Zoom AI makes sense for companies already using Zoom who want simple meeting summaries and don't need complex integrations or workflows. The native integration and desktop apps make it convenient for teams that just want basic meeting intelligence without changing their existing setup.

Fireflies works better for companies using multiple meeting platforms and needing their meeting data in other tools like HubSpot or Notion. The free tier and automation features help teams that want to do more with their meeting content, though like Zoom AI it still requires manual effort to turn insights into action.
