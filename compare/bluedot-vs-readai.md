# Bluedot vs Read.ai for meeting automation

Bluedot is an AI meeting recorder and transcriber that operates as a Chrome extension, working on Google Meet, Zoom, Microsoft Teams, and other platforms without requiring a meeting bot. It records meetings in real-time, generates AI-powered notes, and can sync these to various systems including CRM tools (Salesforce, HubSpot), project tools (Notion, Slack), and Google Docs. The tool supports over 100 languages for transcription and functions whether you're hosting the meeting or not.

The service operates on a tiered pricing model: a free version limited to 5 lifetime meetings, Basic at $18/month for unlimited audio recordings (1-hour max), Pro at $25/month adding unlimited video recording and custom templates, and Business at $40/month with CRM integrations and unlimited guest members. Bluedot works on desktop Chrome browsers with limited mobile support, and records locally via its application, making it suitable for both virtual and in-person meetings.

Read.ai is an AI meeting copilot that provides real-time transcription, summaries, and analytics for virtual meetings across Zoom, Teams, and Google Meet. It generates reports with key points, action items, and metrics like speaker time distribution, sentiment analysis, and attention scores. The platform includes an AI search function across all meeting transcripts and can handle asynchronous communication by summarizing Slack threads or emails. It supports over 20 languages with real-time translation capabilities and offers integrations with tools like HubSpot, Salesforce, Confluence, Jira, Notion, and Slack.

The service is tiered with a free plan allowing 5 meeting transcripts monthly, a Pro plan at $19.75/user/month (annual) for unlimited meetings and integrations, and Enterprise plans starting at $29.75/user/month with video playback features. Read.ai works via web app and browser extensions rather than a desktop client, offers an iOS app for recording in-person meetings, and doesn't require meeting bots to join calls. Some users find the interface complex, and privacy concerns exist around joining others' meetings with the tool without consent.

## Comparing Bluedot and Read.ai

### Bluedot
* Bluedot offers Chrome-based meeting recording without requiring a bot, working across major platforms like Zoom and Teams. It provides accurate transcription in over 100 languages and syncs to CRMs and project tools, though its limited free version and lack of mobile support restrict accessibility.
* While praised for transcription accuracy and discreet background recording, Bluedot has notable limitations in its integration depth and post-meeting productivity features. The tiered pricing structure with the most useful features locked behind higher-cost plans makes it less accessible for small teams that need comprehensive meeting assistance.

### Read.ai
* Read.ai functions as a meeting copilot that transcribes meetings and analyzes engagement and sentiment, supporting 20+ languages and offering real-time transcription with on-the-fly summaries. Despite its comprehensive feature set, it falls short on workflow automation and has limited third-party integrations for post-meeting productivity.
* The tool creates reports with key points and metrics like speaking time and sentiment, but its complex UI and restrictive free tier (5 meetings monthly) create barriers to adoption. While it has valuable meeting analytics capabilities, it lacks the depth of integration needed to seamlessly incorporate meeting outcomes into actionable workflows.
