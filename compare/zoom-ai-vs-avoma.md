# Zoom AI vs. Avoma – Which should you choose?  
AI meeting notes platforms provide four primary deliverables:  
  
* Transcripts create a word-for-word record of the meeting. For example, a one-hour product development meeting generates a searchable document containing every feature discussion, technical requirement, and team decision.  
* Action items are pulled directly from the conversation. When someone says "John will update the wireframes by Friday," the AI automatically creates a tracked task with the assignee and deadline.  
* Meeting summaries distill hour-long conversations into 2-3 paragraphs. A 45-minute sprint planning meeting becomes a concise overview of sprint goals, resource allocation, and key decisions.  
* Topic segmentation breaks discussions into labeled sections. A client call covering multiple projects is automatically divided into sections like "Website Redesign," "Q1 Marketing Campaign," and "Budget Review."  
  
In addition to the quality of these deliverables, we'll want to look at a number of other key factors:  
  
* Free trial: can you test it for free before committing?  
* Ease-of-use: does it have a simple, intuitive setup that works for non-technical users?  
* In-person meeting support: can it transcribe audio from live recordings or uploaded files, not just virtual calls?  
* Security and privacy: how is customer data handled on the platform?  
* Integrations: can it connect with your existing stack, like HubSpot, Notion, or Slack?  
* Functionality: does it go beyond transcriptions and actually help you take action?  
* Languages: can it transcribe and summarize meetings in different languages?  
* Desktop and mobile apps: can you access it on Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android for on-the-go meetings?  
* Recordings: is there support for saving and playing back audio and video recordings of meetings?    
## Evaluating Zoom AI and Avoma  
### Zoom AI
* Zoom AI integrates natively with Zoom meetings, providing real-time Q&A, whiteboard AI for diagrams, and meeting assistance with no extra cost for paid Zoom subscribers. The system works within Zoom Chat and offers basic transcription and summarization features for standard meetings.
* Zoom AI only works within Zoom's platform, requires a paid Zoom subscription, and has limitations with speaker identification for non-logged-in participants. The system lacks custom vocabulary options and cannot handle platform-independent meeting scenarios.

### Avoma
* Avoma provides transcription services with speaker separation, AI summaries, and integrations with CRM and calendar systems for meeting workflow management. The platform handles multiple meeting types and offers detailed post-meeting analytics and action items.
* Avoma requires a paid subscription starting at higher price points than basic meeting tools, and includes no free tier beyond the trial period. The system has a steeper learning curve due to feature complexity and occasionally experiences technical issues with meeting joins and speaker identification.  
## Comparison table    
Zoom AI Companion makes sense for companies already using Zoom who want simple meeting summaries and basic follow-up tasks, without having to learn new software or change their workflow. The tool works well enough for basic needs but won't help much with complex meeting workflows or connecting to other business tools.

Avoma fits better for sales teams and companies who need their meeting insights connected to tools like HubSpot, and don't mind spending time learning new software to get more automation features. While it offers more integration options than Zoom AI, it still lacks the deep workflow automation that would make it truly transformative for most teams.
