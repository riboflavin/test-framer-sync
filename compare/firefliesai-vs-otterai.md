# Fireflies.ai vs Otter.ai for meeting automation

Fireflies.ai is a cloud-based AI meeting assistant that joins video conferences as a participant to record, transcribe, and summarize discussions. The system works across major platforms like Zoom, Teams, and Google Meet, providing transcripts with speaker labels and AI-generated summaries of key points and action items. Users can search transcripts by keyword, query meeting content with the AskFred chatbot, and connect to workflow tools like Slack, Asana, and CRM systems. It offers mobile app support and can handle in-person meetings and voice notes.

The service operates on a tiered pricing model with a free plan offering limited credits, a Pro plan (~$10/user/month) for unlimited audio recording, and a Business plan (~$19/user/month) that adds video recording and analytics. Fireflies transcribes in over 100 languages and offers numerous integrations, though it lacks a dedicated desktop app. Users report good transcription quality across languages but note that accuracy can decrease with heavy accents or technical jargon, and some find the AI summaries too high-level.

Otter.ai is an AI note-taking service that transcribes meetings and audio recordings in real-time, providing searchable transcripts with speaker identification. It integrates with video conferencing platforms like Zoom and Teams through an assistant that can join meetings, and can capture content from screens including slides. The platform automatically generates summaries and highlights of key discussion points, allowing users to comment or highlight sections during meetings.

The service offers tiered pricing starting with a free plan allowing 600 minutes of transcription monthly, with paid plans starting around $10/month for increased minutes and features. It works for both online and in-person conversations through its web and mobile apps, though it primarily supports English with limited Spanish and French capabilities. Otter includes the "OtterPilot" feature that automates summary creation and integrates with tools like HubSpot, Notion, and Slack.

## Comparing Fireflies.ai and Otter.ai

### Fireflies.ai

* Fireflies joins meetings as a bot to record, transcribe and generate action items with capabilities across major platforms. The tool offers searchable transcripts and chatbot functionality, but lacks deep workflow integrations that would make meeting content truly actionable beyond basic summaries.

* While Fireflies supports 100+ languages and integrates with common platforms like Salesforce and Slack, users report issues with summary quality and transcription accuracy for accents or technical jargon. The limited automation capabilities and feature restrictions on lower-tier plans reduce its utility for teams needing comprehensive meeting intelligence.

### Otter.ai

* Otter provides live transcription during meetings with speaker identification and automatic summaries, working across platforms through its meeting assistant. Despite offering real-time features, Otter's integration ecosystem lacks depth needed to effectively transform transcripts into actionable workflows that improve productivity.

* Users appreciate the real-time transcription capabilities and time-saving aspects, but encounter problems with verbose, poorly structured transcripts and accuracy issues with complex audio. The limited language support (primarily English with some Spanish and French) and basic automation restrict its utility for global organizations.

Fireflies.ai tends to work better for multinational teams needing language support across diverse meeting contexts. The tool's strengths in supporting numerous languages and basic CRM integrations make it suitable for sales teams and global organizations that require simple meeting capture across different communication platforms.

Otter.ai is more appropriate for English-speaking users who need real-time transcription and the ability to interact with transcripts during meetings. Its OtterPilot feature offers slightly more robust automation for teams that primarily use English and need basic follow-up mechanisms, though both tools ultimately fall short on transforming meeting content into truly actionable workflows.

The 40-minute cap on free Zoom meetings is a frequently cited limitation.
