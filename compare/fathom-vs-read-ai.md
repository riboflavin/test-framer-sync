# Fathom vs. Read.ai – Which should you choose?  
AI meeting notes platforms provide four primary deliverables:  
  
* Transcripts create a word-for-word record of the meeting. For example, a one-hour product development meeting generates a searchable document containing every feature discussion, technical requirement, and team decision.  
* Action items are pulled directly from the conversation. When someone says "John will update the wireframes by Friday," the AI automatically creates a tracked task with the assignee and deadline.  
* Meeting summaries distill hour-long conversations into 2-3 paragraphs. A 45-minute sprint planning meeting becomes a concise overview of sprint goals, resource allocation, and key decisions.  
* Topic segmentation breaks discussions into labeled sections. A client call covering multiple projects is automatically divided into sections like "Website Redesign," "Q1 Marketing Campaign," and "Budget Review."  
  
In addition to the quality of these deliverables, we'll want to look at a number of other key factors:  
  
* Free trial: can you test it for free before committing?  
* Ease-of-use: does it have a simple, intuitive setup that works for non-technical users?  
* In-person meeting support: can it transcribe audio from live recordings or uploaded files, not just virtual calls?  
* Security and privacy: how is customer data handled on the platform?  
* Integrations: can it connect with your existing stack, like HubSpot, Notion, or Slack?  
* Functionality: does it go beyond transcriptions and actually help you take action?  
* Languages: can it transcribe and summarize meetings in different languages?  
* Desktop and mobile apps: can you access it on Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android for on-the-go meetings?  
* Recordings: is there support for saving and playing back audio and video recordings of meetings?    
## Evaluating Fathom and Read.ai  
### Fathom
* Fathom offers generous free transcription and AI summaries for live meetings, with quick post-meeting processing and multiple summary formats. The interface is minimal and meetings can only be captured live, with no external audio upload support, and some features like meeting templates require paid plans.

### Read.ai
* Read.ai provides meeting transcription plus engagement analytics, multi-language support, real-time translation, and integrations with Slack, Notion, and Confluence. The free plan limits users to 5 meetings monthly, the interface requires more learning time than competitors, and enterprise pricing is higher than average.  
## Comparison table    
Fathom works best for remote teams who need basic automation and want a desktop experience, though its lack of mobile apps and in-person features limit its usefulness. The desktop app and automation features help distributed teams stay organized, but the platform needs deeper integrations to be truly valuable.

Read.ai makes more sense for hybrid teams who need both in-person and remote meeting support, with its mobile apps enabling on-the-go access. While it handles recording and basic meeting functions well, it lacks automation capabilities and needs a more comprehensive integration ecosystem to deliver real productivity gains.
