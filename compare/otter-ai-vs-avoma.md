# Otter.ai vs. Avoma: Which should you choose?
AI meeting notes platforms provide four primary deliverables:

• Transcripts create a word-for-word record of the meeting. For example, a one-hour product development meeting generates a searchable document containing every feature discussion, technical requirement, and team decision.
• Action items are pulled directly from the conversation. When someone says "John will update the wireframes by Friday," the AI automatically creates a tracked task with the assignee and deadline.
• Meeting summaries distill hour-long conversations into 2-3 paragraphs. A 45-minute sprint planning meeting becomes a concise overview of sprint goals, resource allocation, and key decisions.
• Topic segmentation breaks discussions into labeled sections. A client call covering multiple projects is automatically divided into sections like "Website Redesign," "Q1 Marketing Campaign," and "Budget Review."

In addition to the quality of these deliverables, we'll want to look at a number of other key factors:

• Free trial: can you test it for free before committing?
• Ease-of-use: does it have a simple, intuitive setup that works for non-technical users?
• In-person meeting support: can it transcribe audio from live recordings or uploaded files, not just virtual calls?
• Security and privacy: how is customer data handled on the platform?
• Integrations: can it connect with your existing stack, like HubSpot, Notion, or Slack?
• Functionality: does it go beyond transcriptions and actually help you take action?
• Languages: can it transcribe and summarize meetings in different languages?
• Desktop and mobile apps: can you access it on Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android for on-the-go meeitngs?
• Recordings: is there support for saving and playing back audio and video recordings of meetings?

Otter.ai's free plan and integration with Zoom and calendars make it suitable for individuals or small businesses looking for basic meeting transcription capabilities. However, its lack of integrations with popular tools like HubSpot and Notion may limit its usefulness for those seeking a more comprehensive solution. Additionally, its inability to support in-person meetings and local recording may hinder its practicality for certain users.

Avoma's automation engine and integration with a variety of tools like HubSpot and Notion make it appealing to larger companies or teams looking for a more robust meeting management solution. Despite its ease of use, the learning curve and limited language support may pose challenges for some users. Both tools may fall short in terms of depth of integrations and actual utility in helping users effectively manage their meetings.
