# Otter.ai vs. Avoma: Which should you choose?  
AI meeting notes platforms provide four primary deliverables:  
  
* Transcripts create a word-for-word record of the meeting. For example, a one-hour product development meeting generates a searchable document containing every feature discussion, technical requirement, and team decision.  
* Action items are pulled directly from the conversation. When someone says "John will update the wireframes by Friday," the AI automatically creates a tracked task with the assignee and deadline.  
* Meeting summaries distill hour-long conversations into 2-3 paragraphs. A 45-minute sprint planning meeting becomes a concise overview of sprint goals, resource allocation, and key decisions.  
* Topic segmentation breaks discussions into labeled sections. A client call covering multiple projects is automatically divided into sections like "Website Redesign," "Q1 Marketing Campaign," and "Budget Review."  
  
In addition to the quality of these deliverables, we'll want to look at a number of other key factors:  
  
* Free trial: can you test it for free before committing?  
* Ease-of-use: does it have a simple, intuitive setup that works for non-technical users?  
* In-person meeting support: can it transcribe audio from live recordings or uploaded files, not just virtual calls?  
* Security and privacy: how is customer data handled on the platform?  
* Integrations: can it connect with your existing stack, like HubSpot, Notion, or Slack?  
* Functionality: does it go beyond transcriptions and actually help you take action?  
* Languages: can it transcribe and summarize meetings in different languages?  
* Desktop and mobile apps: can you access it on Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android for on-the-go meetings?  
* Recordings: is there support for saving and playing back audio and video recordings of meetings?    
## Evaluating Otter.ai and Avoma  
Otter.ai:
- Pros: Easy to use interface, live editing of transcripts, strong free plan with generous limits, seamless integration with Zoom & calendar for auto-recording meetings.
- Cons: Transcription errors with accents or fast speech, only supports English, hit-or-miss speaker ID requiring manual fixes in notes.

Avoma:
- Pros: Highly accurate transcriptions, excellent AI summaries and highlights, clear speaker separation and labeling in notes, workflow integrations for follow-ups.
- Cons: No free tier, expensive for full features, complex for new users with a learning curve, meeting bot may join late or miss speaker names.

**Otter.ai**: Companies or individuals looking for a free plan with Zoom and calendar integration may find Otter.ai appealing. However, its limited integrations and lack of automation may hinder productivity for users seeking more comprehensive meeting solutions.

**Avoma**: Users interested in a tool with a learning curve, but offering automation and integrations with HubSpot and Notion, may consider Avoma. Despite its strengths, both tools fall short in providing depth of integrations and practical meeting assistance, potentially limiting their effectiveness for users.
