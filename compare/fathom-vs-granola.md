# Fathom vs. Granola: Which should you choose?  
AI meeting notes platforms provide four primary deliverables:  
  
* Transcripts create a word-for-word record of the meeting. For example, a one-hour product development meeting generates a searchable document containing every feature discussion, technical requirement, and team decision.  
* Action items are pulled directly from the conversation. When someone says "John will update the wireframes by Friday," the AI automatically creates a tracked task with the assignee and deadline.  
* Meeting summaries distill hour-long conversations into 2-3 paragraphs. A 45-minute sprint planning meeting becomes a concise overview of sprint goals, resource allocation, and key decisions.  
* Topic segmentation breaks discussions into labeled sections. A client call covering multiple projects is automatically divided into sections like "Website Redesign," "Q1 Marketing Campaign," and "Budget Review."  
  
In addition to the quality of these deliverables, we'll want to look at a number of other key factors:  
  
* Free trial: can you test it for free before committing?  
* Ease-of-use: does it have a simple, intuitive setup that works for non-technical users?  
* In-person meeting support: can it transcribe audio from live recordings or uploaded files, not just virtual calls?  
* Security and privacy: how is customer data handled on the platform?  
* Integrations: can it connect with your existing stack, like HubSpot, Notion, or Slack?  
* Functionality: does it go beyond transcriptions and actually help you take action?  
* Languages: can it transcribe and summarize meetings in different languages?  
* Desktop and mobile apps: can you access it on Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android for on-the-go meetings?  
* Recordings: is there support for saving and playing back audio and video recordings of meetings?    
## Evaluating Fathom and Granola  
**Fathom:**
- Pros: Top-notch accuracy in transcripts, quick high-quality summaries, free unlimited core features, supports many languages.
- Cons: Historically Zoom-only, some duplicate note issues, lacks live collaboration, advanced features require paid plan.

**Granola:**
- Pros: Minimal user-friendly app, no meeting bot needed, custom templates for notes, accurate transcription quality.
- Cons: MacOS only, few integrations, lacks multi-user features, still adding features.  
| Feature                           | Fathom       | Granola      |
|-----------------------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Trial/Free Plan                   | ✅ Free unlimited plan | ✅ Free trial (25 meetings) |
| Zoom & Calendar Integration       | ✅ Yes       | ❌ No        |
| Easy to Use?                      | ✅ Very easy | ✅ Super easy |
| Good for In-Person Meetings?      | ❌ No        | ✅ Yes       |
| Good for Local Recording?         | ❌ No        | ✅ Yes       |
| Integrates with HubSpot, Notion, etc.? | ✅ Yes | ❌ No        |
| Automation Engine?                | ❌ No        | ❌ No        |
| Language Support                  | ✅ Multiple languages | ❌ English only |
| Desktop App                       | ❌ No (Web-based) | ✅ Yes (Mac-only) |
| iPhone & Android Apps             | ✅ Yes (Both) | ❌ No        |  
- Fathom may appeal to individuals or companies seeking a tool with free unlimited access and integration with Zoom and calendars, but falls short in its lack of support for in-person meetings and local recording. While it does integrate with popular platforms like HubSpot and Notion, its absence of an automation engine limits its utility in streamlining meeting processes.

- On the other hand, Granola could be preferred by users looking for a straightforward solution with a free trial option and easy-to-use interface. However, its limitations in integrations with other tools and lack of depth in features like automation and language support may hinder its ability to truly enhance meeting productivity and efficiency.
