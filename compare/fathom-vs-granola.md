# Fathom vs. Granola – Which should you choose?  
AI meeting notes platforms provide four primary deliverables:  
  
* Transcripts create a word-for-word record of the meeting. For example, a one-hour product development meeting generates a searchable document containing every feature discussion, technical requirement, and team decision.  
* Action items are pulled directly from the conversation. When someone says "John will update the wireframes by Friday," the AI automatically creates a tracked task with the assignee and deadline.  
* Meeting summaries distill hour-long conversations into 2-3 paragraphs. A 45-minute sprint planning meeting becomes a concise overview of sprint goals, resource allocation, and key decisions.  
* Topic segmentation breaks discussions into labeled sections. A client call covering multiple projects is automatically divided into sections like "Website Redesign," "Q1 Marketing Campaign," and "Budget Review."  
  
In addition to the quality of these deliverables, we'll want to look at a number of other key factors:  
  
* Free trial: can you test it for free before committing?  
* Ease-of-use: does it have a simple, intuitive setup that works for non-technical users?  
* In-person meeting support: can it transcribe audio from live recordings or uploaded files, not just virtual calls?  
* Security and privacy: how is customer data handled on the platform?  
* Integrations: can it connect with your existing stack, like HubSpot, Notion, or Slack?  
* Functionality: does it go beyond transcriptions and actually help you take action?  
* Languages: can it transcribe and summarize meetings in different languages?  
* Desktop and mobile apps: can you access it on Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android for on-the-go meetings?  
* Recordings: is there support for saving and playing back audio and video recordings of meetings?    
## Evaluating Fathom and Granola  
### Fathom
* Offers unlimited free usage of core features, accurate transcription with multi-speaker support, and summaries that capture key points. Works in multiple languages and recently expanded beyond Zoom to other platforms in beta.
* Has issues with duplicate notes during team usage, lacks real-time collaborative editing, and requires paid plans for advanced features like custom integrations and analytics.

### Granola
* Functions by listening on device without meeting bots, works like a standard notepad, uses custom templates for summaries, and provides transcription for missed details.
* Limited to MacOS currently, has minimal third-party integrations, focuses on individual rather than team use, and offers basic transcript editing capabilities as a new product.  
## Comparison table    
Fathom works best for remote teams who live in Zoom and need basic integrations with tools like HubSpot, though it lacks the automation features that would make it truly powerful. The platform's support for multiple languages and mobile apps makes it accessible for global teams, but its web-only interface and inability to handle in-person meetings limit its usefulness.

Granola is clearly built for Mac users who primarily conduct in-person meetings and want local recording capabilities without relying on cloud services. While it offers a clean, simple experience for face-to-face interactions, its lack of calendar integration and mobile support make it less practical for hybrid teams, and like Fathom, it doesn't provide the workflow automation that could make it indispensable.
