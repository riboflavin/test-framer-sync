# Fathom vs. Granola – Which should you choose?  
AI meeting notes platforms provide four primary deliverables:  
  
* Transcripts create a word-for-word record of the meeting. For example, a one-hour product development meeting generates a searchable document containing every feature discussion, technical requirement, and team decision.  
* Action items are pulled directly from the conversation. When someone says "John will update the wireframes by Friday," the AI automatically creates a tracked task with the assignee and deadline.  
* Meeting summaries distill hour-long conversations into 2-3 paragraphs. A 45-minute sprint planning meeting becomes a concise overview of sprint goals, resource allocation, and key decisions.  
* Topic segmentation breaks discussions into labeled sections. A client call covering multiple projects is automatically divided into sections like "Website Redesign," "Q1 Marketing Campaign," and "Budget Review."  
  
In addition to the quality of these deliverables, we'll want to look at a number of other key factors:  
  
* Free trial: can you test it for free before committing?  
* Ease-of-use: does it have a simple, intuitive setup that works for non-technical users?  
* In-person meeting support: can it transcribe audio from live recordings or uploaded files, not just virtual calls?  
* Security and privacy: how is customer data handled on the platform?  
* Integrations: can it connect with your existing stack, like HubSpot, Notion, or Slack?  
* Functionality: does it go beyond transcriptions and actually help you take action?  
* Languages: can it transcribe and summarize meetings in different languages?  
* Desktop and mobile apps: can you access it on Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android for on-the-go meetings?  
* Recordings: is there support for saving and playing back audio and video recordings of meetings?    
## Evaluating Fathom and Granola  
### Fathom
* Fathom offers a free plan with transcription and AI summaries that appear seconds after meetings, with different summary formats available and live meeting support. The platform lacks external audio file upload capability, requires desktop use without a mobile app, and keeps some features like meeting templates restricted to paid plans.

### Granola
* Granola provides automated note-taking with customizable templates and operates without visible meeting interference through a simple interface similar to Apple Notes. The tool is currently Mac-only, lacks a mobile app, requires system audio capture to function, and shows some limitations due to being a newer platform.  
## Comparison table    
Fathom works best for remote teams who need basic automation and want their meeting content synced to other tools, though the integrations are fairly shallow. The lack of in-person recording and mobile apps limits its usefulness for hybrid teams who meet in conference rooms or need to access content on the go.

Granola makes sense for Mac-based teams who frequently meet in person and want to keep their recordings local, though its limited automation and partial integrations mean more manual work. The Mac-only desktop app and lack of mobile support means it's not ideal for cross-platform organizations or teams needing flexible access to their meeting content.
