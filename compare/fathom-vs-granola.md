# Fathom vs Granola for meeting automation

Fathom is an AI meeting notetaker that works with Zoom, Google Meet, and Teams. It records meetings, transcribes in real-time in 25+ languages, and generates different summary formats like bullet lists, action items, and detailed chronological summaries. The system identifies speakers, allows users to highlight key moments during calls, provides post-meeting overviews, and includes an "Ask Fathom" feature for querying meeting content. It's used primarily by sales reps and anyone wanting to focus on conversation rather than note-taking.

The service offers a free plan with unlimited recordings and 5 AI-summarized meetings monthly, with paid tiers starting at $15/month for unlimited AI note-taking. Fathom works only with scheduled online meetings (not uploaded audio files or in-person meetings), has no mobile app, and requires a desktop application. It integrates with CRMs like HubSpot and Salesforce, plus Slack and Notion, and automatically generates summaries and action items that can be synced to other platforms.

Granola is an AI notepad for meetings that runs on Mac computers, capturing system audio without requiring a bot in the call. Users can type brief notes during meetings, after which Granola combines the audio and notes to produce enhanced, structured summaries with sections like key takeaways and next steps. It works with all meeting platforms (Zoom, Teams, Webex, Slack Huddles) and offers customizable note templates and an AI assistant for generating follow-up content.

The app operates locally, recording and transcribing meetings offline on Mac devices (Windows not currently supported). It supports approximately 16 languages, includes calendar sync, and offers Notion export with HubSpot integration in beta. Pricing starts with a 25-meeting free trial, followed by an $18/month Individual plan, $14/user/month Business plan with team sharing, and a $35/user/month Enterprise option with advanced compliance features.

## Comparing Fathom and Granola

### Fathom
* Fathom offers real-time transcription and AI-generated summaries for video meetings, focusing primarily on Zoom, Google Meet, and Teams integration. While it provides useful features like speaker identification and action item extraction, it lacks comprehensive integrations beyond a few CRMs and doesn't effectively connect meeting outcomes to actual workflow.

### Granola
* Granola functions by capturing system audio on Mac devices, combining minimal user notes with AI to generate structured meeting summaries. Despite working across all meeting platforms without requiring a bot, it falls short with limited integration options and doesn't provide robust tools to translate meeting content into actionable workflows.

| Feature | Fathom | Granola |
|---------|--------|---------|
| Free Plan | ✅ | ❌ |
| Meeting Platforms | Limited | All Platforms |
| In-person Support | ❌ | Partial |
| Local Recording | Partial | ✅ |
| Integrations | Basic CRM | Very Limited |
| Automation | Basic | ❌ |
| Language Support | 25+ | 16 |
| Desktop App | Mac/Windows | Mac Only |
| Mobile App | ❌ | ❌ |

Fathom works best for teams heavily invested in Zoom or Teams who need a reliable way to capture meeting content with minimal setup. Sales teams particularly benefit from its CRM integrations, though they'll likely find the workflow automations too basic for complex sales processes. The generous free tier makes it accessible for individuals and small teams.

Granola appeals to Mac users who attend meetings across multiple platforms and prefer a less intrusive note-taking solution. Its ability to work offline and capture any meeting without adding a bot makes it ideal for consultants or those attending sensitive client meetings. However, the lack of Windows support and limited integrations make it less suitable for enterprise environments where cross-platform functionality is essential.

## Fathom vs Granola: What do users say?

Fathom and Granola represent two different approaches to AI meeting assistance. Fathom, which integrates with Zoom, Google Meet, and Teams, receives praise for its generous free plan that allows unlimited recordings with full AI summaries for 5 meetings monthly. Users highlight its accurate transcriptions, intuitive interface, and responsive customer service. The platform automatically generates summaries, action items, and can push content to CRMs. However, some users note that advanced features require paid plans, there's no mobile app, and it can't process external audio files.

Granola takes a different approach as an AI notepad that runs on Mac computers and listens to meetings without requiring a bot in the call. Users appreciate its "set and forget" functionality that allows them to focus on conversations while still getting quality notes afterward. Its clean interface draws comparisons to Apple Notes for simplicity. The main limitations include its Mac-only availability (though Windows support is reportedly coming), lack of a mobile app, and dependency on system audio capture.
