# Otter.ai vs. Zoom AI – Which should you choose?  
AI meeting notes platforms provide four primary deliverables:  
  
* Transcripts create a word-for-word record of the meeting. For example, a one-hour product development meeting generates a searchable document containing every feature discussion, technical requirement, and team decision.  
* Action items are pulled directly from the conversation. When someone says "John will update the wireframes by Friday," the AI automatically creates a tracked task with the assignee and deadline.  
* Meeting summaries distill hour-long conversations into 2-3 paragraphs. A 45-minute sprint planning meeting becomes a concise overview of sprint goals, resource allocation, and key decisions.  
* Topic segmentation breaks discussions into labeled sections. A client call covering multiple projects is automatically divided into sections like "Website Redesign," "Q1 Marketing Campaign," and "Budget Review."  
  
In addition to the quality of these deliverables, we'll want to look at a number of other key factors:  
  
* Free trial: can you test it for free before committing?  
* Ease-of-use: does it have a simple, intuitive setup that works for non-technical users?  
* In-person meeting support: can it transcribe audio from live recordings or uploaded files, not just virtual calls?  
* Security and privacy: how is customer data handled on the platform?  
* Integrations: can it connect with your existing stack, like HubSpot, Notion, or Slack?  
* Functionality: does it go beyond transcriptions and actually help you take action?  
* Languages: can it transcribe and summarize meetings in different languages?  
* Desktop and mobile apps: can you access it on Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android for on-the-go meetings?  
* Recordings: is there support for saving and playing back audio and video recordings of meetings?    
## Evaluating Otter.ai and Zoom AI  
### Otter.ai
- Easy to use; intuitive interface and live editing of transcripts.
- Strong free plan with generous transcription limits.
- Seamless integration with Zoom & calendar for auto-recording meetings.
- Transcription errors with accents or fast speech (not as accurate as human).
- Only supports English, which is limiting.
- Speaker ID can be hit-or-miss, requiring manual fixes in notes.

### Zoom AI
- Native integration – no setup if you use Zoom, and outputs appear right in Zoom Chat.
- Real-time Q&A and assistance during meetings (ask the AI on the fly).
- Unique whiteboard AI for creating mind-maps/diagrams in meeting.
- Included with paid Zoom (no extra fee for existing Zoom subscribers).
- Zoom-only: Doesn’t work on Google Meet, Teams, etc.
- No free access – requires a Zoom paid plan (~$15+ monthly).
- Speaker ID limits: won’t capture anyone not logged in as Zoom user (e.g., a speaker in the room).
- No custom vocabulary, so industry jargon may transcribe poorly.

Both Otter.ai and Zoom AI have their limitations when it comes to integrations with other tools, such as HubSpot and Notion. While Zoom AI offers native integration with Zoom and calendar, Otter.ai falls short in this aspect, lacking the depth of integrations that some users may require.

Both tools may not fully meet the needs of users looking to enhance their meeting productivity, as they lack an automation engine and are not particularly suited for in-person meetings or local recording. Additionally, the language support is limited to English only for both Otter.ai and Zoom AI, which may be a drawback for users who require multilingual capabilities.
