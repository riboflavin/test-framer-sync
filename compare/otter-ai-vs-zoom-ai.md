# Otter.ai vs. Zoom AI – Which should you choose?  
AI meeting notes platforms provide four primary deliverables:  
  
* Transcripts create a word-for-word record of the meeting. For example, a one-hour product development meeting generates a searchable document containing every feature discussion, technical requirement, and team decision.  
* Action items are pulled directly from the conversation. When someone says "John will update the wireframes by Friday," the AI automatically creates a tracked task with the assignee and deadline.  
* Meeting summaries distill hour-long conversations into 2-3 paragraphs. A 45-minute sprint planning meeting becomes a concise overview of sprint goals, resource allocation, and key decisions.  
* Topic segmentation breaks discussions into labeled sections. A client call covering multiple projects is automatically divided into sections like "Website Redesign," "Q1 Marketing Campaign," and "Budget Review."  
  
In addition to the quality of these deliverables, we'll want to look at a number of other key factors:  
  
* Free trial: can you test it for free before committing?  
* Ease-of-use: does it have a simple, intuitive setup that works for non-technical users?  
* In-person meeting support: can it transcribe audio from live recordings or uploaded files, not just virtual calls?  
* Security and privacy: how is customer data handled on the platform?  
* Integrations: can it connect with your existing stack, like HubSpot, Notion, or Slack?  
* Functionality: does it go beyond transcriptions and actually help you take action?  
* Languages: can it transcribe and summarize meetings in different languages?  
* Desktop and mobile apps: can you access it on Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android for on-the-go meetings?  
* Recordings: is there support for saving and playing back audio and video recordings of meetings?    
## Evaluating Otter.ai and Zoom AI  
### Otter.ai
* Otter.ai transcribes meetings in real-time with commenting and highlighting features, captures meeting themes for AI summaries, and offers a free tier with basic functionality. The tool has issues with transcript verbosity, accuracy with complex audio, unwanted calendar integration, and a 40-minute limit on free meetings.

### Zoom AI
* Zoom AI integrates directly into Zoom meetings, generates instant meeting summaries with action items, and comes included with paid Zoom accounts. The tool only works within Zoom meetings, has basic chat integration, limited meeting management controls, and some users report difficulties sharing AI notes outside of Zoom.  
## Comparison table    
Small teams and freelancers who need to record in-person meetings or want flexibility across different conferencing platforms will prefer Otter, though they'll need to build their own workflows around the limited integration options. The free tier and mobile-first approach make it accessible, while the automation features help compensate for the lack of a proper desktop experience.

Large organizations already standardized on Zoom will naturally gravitate toward Zoom AI for its tight platform integration and enterprise security features, despite its inability to handle in-person scenarios well. The desktop-centric approach and broad language support are appealing, but users will find themselves manually handling many post-meeting tasks that could be automated.
