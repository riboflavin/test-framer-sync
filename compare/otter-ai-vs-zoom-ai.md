# Otter.ai vs. Zoom AI – Which should you choose?  
AI meeting notes platforms provide four primary deliverables:  
  
* Transcripts create a word-for-word record of the meeting. For example, a one-hour product development meeting generates a searchable document containing every feature discussion, technical requirement, and team decision.  
* Action items are pulled directly from the conversation. When someone says "John will update the wireframes by Friday," the AI automatically creates a tracked task with the assignee and deadline.  
* Meeting summaries distill hour-long conversations into 2-3 paragraphs. A 45-minute sprint planning meeting becomes a concise overview of sprint goals, resource allocation, and key decisions.  
* Topic segmentation breaks discussions into labeled sections. A client call covering multiple projects is automatically divided into sections like "Website Redesign," "Q1 Marketing Campaign," and "Budget Review."  
  
In addition to the quality of these deliverables, we'll want to look at a number of other key factors:  
  
* Free trial: can you test it for free before committing?  
* Ease-of-use: does it have a simple, intuitive setup that works for non-technical users?  
* In-person meeting support: can it transcribe audio from live recordings or uploaded files, not just virtual calls?  
* Security and privacy: how is customer data handled on the platform?  
* Integrations: can it connect with your existing stack, like HubSpot, Notion, or Slack?  
* Functionality: does it go beyond transcriptions and actually help you take action?  
* Languages: can it transcribe and summarize meetings in different languages?  
* Desktop and mobile apps: can you access it on Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android for on-the-go meetings?  
* Recordings: is there support for saving and playing back audio and video recordings of meetings?    
## Evaluating Otter.ai and Zoom AI  
### Otter.ai
* Otter.ai offers free transcription with generous limits and integrates with Zoom and calendars for automatic recording, with an interface that allows live transcript editing. The service has limitations with accent recognition and fast speech transcription, only supports English, and sometimes requires manual fixes for speaker identification.

### Zoom AI
* Zoom AI comes built into Zoom with real-time Q&A, whiteboard features for diagrams, and meeting transcription included in paid Zoom subscriptions. The tool only works within Zoom meetings, requires a paid Zoom plan, cannot identify speakers who aren't logged in, and lacks custom vocabulary for specialized terminology.  
## Comparison table    
Small teams and freelancers who need a free meeting assistant and don't mind using a web browser should try Otter.ai. The free plan and simple interface make it accessible, though its limited integrations mean you'll still need to do most of the work manually.

Companies already invested in Zoom's ecosystem will find Zoom AI's native integration convenient, especially with the desktop app. While it requires a paid Zoom plan and lacks meaningful third-party integrations, it provides a familiar experience for teams already using Zoom daily.
