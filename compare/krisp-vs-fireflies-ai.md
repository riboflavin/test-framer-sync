# Krisp vs. Fireflies.ai – Which should you choose?  
AI meeting notes platforms provide four primary deliverables:  
  
* Transcripts create a word-for-word record of the meeting. For example, a one-hour product development meeting generates a searchable document containing every feature discussion, technical requirement, and team decision.  
* Action items are pulled directly from the conversation. When someone says "John will update the wireframes by Friday," the AI automatically creates a tracked task with the assignee and deadline.  
* Meeting summaries distill hour-long conversations into 2-3 paragraphs. A 45-minute sprint planning meeting becomes a concise overview of sprint goals, resource allocation, and key decisions.  
* Topic segmentation breaks discussions into labeled sections. A client call covering multiple projects is automatically divided into sections like "Website Redesign," "Q1 Marketing Campaign," and "Budget Review."  
  
In addition to the quality of these deliverables, we'll want to look at a number of other key factors:  
  
* Free trial: can you test it for free before committing?  
* Ease-of-use: does it have a simple, intuitive setup that works for non-technical users?  
* In-person meeting support: can it transcribe audio from live recordings or uploaded files, not just virtual calls?  
* Security and privacy: how is customer data handled on the platform?  
* Integrations: can it connect with your existing stack, like HubSpot, Notion, or Slack?  
* Functionality: does it go beyond transcriptions and actually help you take action?  
* Languages: can it transcribe and summarize meetings in different languages?  
* Desktop and mobile apps: can you access it on Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android for on-the-go meetings?  
* Recordings: is there support for saving and playing back audio and video recordings of meetings?

### Fireflies.ai
- Wide compatibility – works with Zoom, Teams, Meet, etc. via bot.

## Comparison table    
Some individuals or organizations that might consider using Krisp could be small businesses or freelancers looking for a simple and free tool to improve their online meetings. However, those seeking deeper integrations with tools like HubSpot or Notion may find Krisp lacking in that aspect. Additionally, users looking to streamline their meeting processes through automation may also find Krisp to be limited in this regard.

On the other hand, Fireflies.ai could be appealing to professionals or companies that heavily rely on Zoom and calendar integrations for their meetings. Despite its ease of use and language support, Fireflies.ai may not fully meet the needs of users who require local recording capabilities or a wide range of integrations beyond HubSpot and Notion. Furthermore, individuals or businesses looking for a desktop app rather than a web-based platform may find Fireflies.ai to be less suitable for their preferences.
