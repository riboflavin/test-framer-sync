# Krisp vs. Fireflies.ai – Which should you choose?  
AI meeting notes platforms provide four primary deliverables:  
  
* Transcripts create a word-for-word record of the meeting. For example, a one-hour product development meeting generates a searchable document containing every feature discussion, technical requirement, and team decision.  
* Action items are pulled directly from the conversation. When someone says "John will update the wireframes by Friday," the AI automatically creates a tracked task with the assignee and deadline.  
* Meeting summaries distill hour-long conversations into 2-3 paragraphs. A 45-minute sprint planning meeting becomes a concise overview of sprint goals, resource allocation, and key decisions.  
* Topic segmentation breaks discussions into labeled sections. A client call covering multiple projects is automatically divided into sections like "Website Redesign," "Q1 Marketing Campaign," and "Budget Review."  
  
In addition to the quality of these deliverables, we'll want to look at a number of other key factors:  
  
* Free trial: can you test it for free before committing?  
* Ease-of-use: does it have a simple, intuitive setup that works for non-technical users?  
* In-person meeting support: can it transcribe audio from live recordings or uploaded files, not just virtual calls?  
* Security and privacy: how is customer data handled on the platform?  
* Integrations: can it connect with your existing stack, like HubSpot, Notion, or Slack?  
* Functionality: does it go beyond transcriptions and actually help you take action?  
* Languages: can it transcribe and summarize meetings in different languages?  
* Desktop and mobile apps: can you access it on Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android for on-the-go meetings?  
* Recordings: is there support for saving and playing back audio and video recordings of meetings?    
## Evaluating Krisp and Fireflies.ai  
### Krisp
* Krisp provides noise cancellation for all audio sources and unlimited transcription across all plans, working with any meeting platform or phone calls. The free tier includes 60 minutes of daily noise removal and two summaries per day, while paid plans remove these limits and add features like custom vocabulary for better accuracy.
* The software focuses on individual use rather than team collaboration, and its AI processing can be resource-intensive during extended meetings. The meeting summaries prioritize brevity over comprehensive detail, which may not suit all use cases.

### Fireflies.ai
* Fireflies.ai integrates with major meeting platforms through a bot system and generates detailed summaries with action items, keyword tracking, and sentiment analysis. The setup process requires only inviting the bot to meetings, and the system automatically emails meeting recaps to participants.
* The platform's free tier has restrictive limits on minutes and storage, and transcription accuracy can vary with accented speech or specialized terminology. The interface includes many features that can create a learning curve, and the default email notification system sends updates for every meeting.  
## Comparison table    
Krisp makes sense for people who need to record in-person meetings or want a simple desktop app that works offline, though its lack of integration with common work tools means you'll be doing extra work to share or use the recordings. The app works well for small teams or independent professionals who primarily need local recording and don't require complex workflow automation.

Fireflies.ai is built for teams already using tools like Zoom, HubSpot, or Notion who want their meeting recordings to flow into their existing systems, but its web-based approach and inability to handle in-person meetings limits its usefulness. While it offers more integrations than Krisp, neither tool provides particularly deep integration with work tools or meaningful help in actually executing on meeting outcomes.
