# Otter.ai vs. Granola: Which should you choose?
AI meeting notes platforms provide four primary deliverables:

• Transcripts create a word-for-word record of the meeting. For example, a one-hour product development meeting generates a searchable document containing every feature discussion, technical requirement, and team decision.
• Action items are pulled directly from the conversation. When someone says "John will update the wireframes by Friday," the AI automatically creates a tracked task with the assignee and deadline.
• Meeting summaries distill hour-long conversations into 2-3 paragraphs. A 45-minute sprint planning meeting becomes a concise overview of sprint goals, resource allocation, and key decisions.
• Topic segmentation breaks discussions into labeled sections. A client call covering multiple projects is automatically divided into sections like "Website Redesign," "Q1 Marketing Campaign," and "Budget Review."

In addition to the quality of these deliverables, we'll want to look at a number of other key factors:

• Free trial: can you test it for free before committing?
• Ease-of-use: does it have a simple, intuitive setup that works for non-technical users?
• In-person meeting support: can it transcribe audio from live recordings or uploaded files, not just virtual calls?
• Security and privacy: how is customer data handled on the platform?
• Integrations: can it connect with your existing stack, like HubSpot, Notion, or Slack?
• Functionality: does it go beyond transcriptions and actually help you take action?
• Languages: can it transcribe and summarize meetings in different languages?
• Desktop and mobile apps: can you access it on Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android for on-the-go meeitngs?
• Recordings: is there support for saving and playing back audio and video recordings of meetings?
## Evaluating Otter.ai and Granola
Otter.ai: Users appreciate its easy-to-use interface, generous free plan, and integration with Zoom and calendar for auto-recording meetings. However, some find its transcription accuracy lacking for accents or fast speech, limited language support to English only, and hit-or-miss speaker ID functionality.

Granola: Users like its minimal, user-friendly design, platform flexibility, custom note templates, and accurate transcription quality. However, it is currently only available on MacOS with a Windows version pending, lacks extensive integrations, does not support multi-user features, and is still in the process of adding more advanced capabilities.

Otter.ai might appeal to individuals or companies looking for a free tool with basic Zoom and calendar integration, but may fall short for those needing deeper integrations with platforms like HubSpot or Notion. While it is easy to use, its limitations in supporting in-person meetings and local recording may hinder its effectiveness in certain scenarios.

Granola, on the other hand, could be suitable for users seeking a straightforward tool with a free trial option and Mac desktop app support. However, its lack of integrations with popular platforms and absence of an automation engine may limit its utility for those looking to streamline meeting processes and tasks effectively.
