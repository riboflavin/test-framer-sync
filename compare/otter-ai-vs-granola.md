# Otter.ai vs. Granola – Which should you choose?  
AI meeting notes platforms provide four primary deliverables:  
  
* Transcripts create a word-for-word record of the meeting. For example, a one-hour product development meeting generates a searchable document containing every feature discussion, technical requirement, and team decision.  
* Action items are pulled directly from the conversation. When someone says "John will update the wireframes by Friday," the AI automatically creates a tracked task with the assignee and deadline.  
* Meeting summaries distill hour-long conversations into 2-3 paragraphs. A 45-minute sprint planning meeting becomes a concise overview of sprint goals, resource allocation, and key decisions.  
* Topic segmentation breaks discussions into labeled sections. A client call covering multiple projects is automatically divided into sections like "Website Redesign," "Q1 Marketing Campaign," and "Budget Review."  
  
In addition to the quality of these deliverables, we'll want to look at a number of other key factors:  
  
* Free trial: can you test it for free before committing?  
* Ease-of-use: does it have a simple, intuitive setup that works for non-technical users?  
* In-person meeting support: can it transcribe audio from live recordings or uploaded files, not just virtual calls?  
* Security and privacy: how is customer data handled on the platform?  
* Integrations: can it connect with your existing stack, like HubSpot, Notion, or Slack?  
* Functionality: does it go beyond transcriptions and actually help you take action?  
* Languages: can it transcribe and summarize meetings in different languages?  
* Desktop and mobile apps: can you access it on Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android for on-the-go meetings?  
* Recordings: is there support for saving and playing back audio and video recordings of meetings?    
## Evaluating Otter.ai and Granola  
### Otter.ai
* Otter offers live transcription with Zoom integration, calendar sync, and meeting auto-recording, along with a free plan that includes substantial transcription time. The interface allows live transcript editing and note-taking during meetings.
* The service struggles with accent recognition and rapid speech patterns, only works in English, and sometimes misidentifies speakers in conversations requiring manual corrections.

### Granola
* Granola functions as a local recording tool that works across platforms without meeting bots, includes note templates for summaries, and provides transcription by listening directly on the device. The app operates independently of meeting platforms.
* The app currently only runs on MacOS, has limited integration options with other tools, lacks collaborative features for multiple users, and contains basic editing capabilities as a new product still in development.  
## Comparison table    
Otter works best for remote teams and companies who live in Zoom calls and need quick transcripts on their phones, though its lack of deep integrations means you'll still be copying and pasting things around. The web-based approach makes it accessible anywhere, but it's not great when you're sitting face to face with someone or need to work offline.

Granola is built for people who do a lot of in-person meetings and want to record locally on their Mac, but the missing mobile apps and calendar integration make it hard to use across a whole team. While it handles local recording well, it doesn't connect deeply with other tools, so you'll still need to manually move information where it needs to go.
