# Otter.ai vs. Granola – Which should you choose?  
AI meeting notes platforms provide four primary deliverables:  
  
* Transcripts create a word-for-word record of the meeting. For example, a one-hour product development meeting generates a searchable document containing every feature discussion, technical requirement, and team decision.  
* Action items are pulled directly from the conversation. When someone says "John will update the wireframes by Friday," the AI automatically creates a tracked task with the assignee and deadline.  
* Meeting summaries distill hour-long conversations into 2-3 paragraphs. A 45-minute sprint planning meeting becomes a concise overview of sprint goals, resource allocation, and key decisions.  
* Topic segmentation breaks discussions into labeled sections. A client call covering multiple projects is automatically divided into sections like "Website Redesign," "Q1 Marketing Campaign," and "Budget Review."  
  
In addition to the quality of these deliverables, we'll want to look at a number of other key factors:  
  
* Free trial: can you test it for free before committing?  
* Ease-of-use: does it have a simple, intuitive setup that works for non-technical users?  
* In-person meeting support: can it transcribe audio from live recordings or uploaded files, not just virtual calls?  
* Security and privacy: how is customer data handled on the platform?  
* Integrations: can it connect with your existing stack, like HubSpot, Notion, or Slack?  
* Functionality: does it go beyond transcriptions and actually help you take action?  
* Languages: can it transcribe and summarize meetings in different languages?  
* Desktop and mobile apps: can you access it on Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android for on-the-go meetings?  
* Recordings: is there support for saving and playing back audio and video recordings of meetings?    
## Evaluating Otter.ai and Granola  
### Otter.ai
- Easy to use; intuitive interface and live editing of transcripts.
- Strong free plan with generous transcription limits.
- Seamless integration with Zoom & calendar for auto-recording meetings.
- Transcription errors with accents or fast speech (not as accurate as human).
- Only supports English, which is limiting.
- Speaker ID can be hit-or-miss, requiring manual fixes in notes.

### Granola
- Minimal, user-friendly app – feels like a regular notepad.
- No meeting bot needed, works on any platform by listening on device (more discreet).
- Custom templates for notes yield tailored summaries.
- Accurate transcription quality helps fill in details you miss.
- MacOS only (Windows version in waitlist; no mobile app yet).
- Few integrations currently; mostly a standalone tool.
- Lacks multi-user features – designed for individual note-taking (you manually share notes after).
- New product – still adding features, so some capabilities (editing transcripts, etc.) are basic.

- Otter.ai might be suitable for individuals or companies looking for a free and easy-to-use tool with Zoom and calendar integration, but falls short in terms of integrations with other platforms and its ability to support in-person meetings and local recording. Granola, on the other hand, could be preferred by those who prioritize local recording and Mac desktop app availability, but lacks integrations with popular tools like HubSpot and Notion, as well as an automation engine to enhance meeting productivity.

- Both Otter.ai and Granola have limitations in their depth of integrations and may not fully meet the needs of users seeking comprehensive solutions to enhance meeting efficiency. While Otter.ai offers Zoom and calendar integration and mobile apps, it lacks support for in-person meetings and local recording. Similarly, Granola provides a Mac desktop app and local recording capabilities, but falls short in terms of integrations with popular platforms and an automation engine to streamline meeting processes.
