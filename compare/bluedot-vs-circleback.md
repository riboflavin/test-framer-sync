# Bluedot vs. Circleback – Which should you choose?  
AI meeting notes platforms provide four primary deliverables:  
  
* Transcripts create a word-for-word record of the meeting. For example, a one-hour product development meeting generates a searchable document containing every feature discussion, technical requirement, and team decision.  
* Action items are pulled directly from the conversation. When someone says "John will update the wireframes by Friday," the AI automatically creates a tracked task with the assignee and deadline.  
* Meeting summaries distill hour-long conversations into 2-3 paragraphs. A 45-minute sprint planning meeting becomes a concise overview of sprint goals, resource allocation, and key decisions.  
* Topic segmentation breaks discussions into labeled sections. A client call covering multiple projects is automatically divided into sections like "Website Redesign," "Q1 Marketing Campaign," and "Budget Review."  
  
In addition to the quality of these deliverables, we'll want to look at a number of other key factors:  
  
* Free trial: can you test it for free before committing?  
* Ease-of-use: does it have a simple, intuitive setup that works for non-technical users?  
* In-person meeting support: can it transcribe audio from live recordings or uploaded files, not just virtual calls?  
* Security and privacy: how is customer data handled on the platform?  
* Integrations: can it connect with your existing stack, like HubSpot, Notion, or Slack?  
* Functionality: does it go beyond transcriptions and actually help you take action?  
* Languages: can it transcribe and summarize meetings in different languages?  
* Desktop and mobile apps: can you access it on Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android for on-the-go meetings?  
* Recordings: is there support for saving and playing back audio and video recordings of meetings?    
## Evaluating Bluedot and Circleback  
### Bluedot
* Bluedot offers transcription without bot invites, works across major meeting platforms, integrates with productivity apps, and includes automatic note syncing. The tool requires Chrome for full functionality, limits free usage to 5 meetings, locks advanced features behind higher tiers, and has incomplete mobile support.

### Circleback
* Circleback provides meeting transcription with summaries and action items, integrates with calendars and business apps, and delivers notes shortly after meetings end. The tool lacks video recording capabilities and has a smaller feature set compared to established competitors.  
## Comparison table    
Bluedot works best for remote teams who need basic meeting tools and don't require mobile access or in-person capabilities. While it offers standard integrations and automation features that most companies need, users might find themselves wanting deeper connections with their daily workflow tools.

Circleback makes more sense for hybrid teams who switch between remote and office work, and need their meeting tools available on all devices. Though it provides similar integration options to Bluedot, teams looking to truly automate their meeting workflows may find themselves manually moving information between systems more often than they'd like.
