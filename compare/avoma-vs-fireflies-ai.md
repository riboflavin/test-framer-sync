# Avoma vs. Fireflies.ai – Which should you choose?  
AI meeting notes platforms provide four primary deliverables:  
  
* Transcripts create a word-for-word record of the meeting. For example, a one-hour product development meeting generates a searchable document containing every feature discussion, technical requirement, and team decision.  
* Action items are pulled directly from the conversation. When someone says "John will update the wireframes by Friday," the AI automatically creates a tracked task with the assignee and deadline.  
* Meeting summaries distill hour-long conversations into 2-3 paragraphs. A 45-minute sprint planning meeting becomes a concise overview of sprint goals, resource allocation, and key decisions.  
* Topic segmentation breaks discussions into labeled sections. A client call covering multiple projects is automatically divided into sections like "Website Redesign," "Q1 Marketing Campaign," and "Budget Review."  
  
In addition to the quality of these deliverables, we'll want to look at a number of other key factors:  
  
* Free trial: can you test it for free before committing?  
* Ease-of-use: does it have a simple, intuitive setup that works for non-technical users?  
* In-person meeting support: can it transcribe audio from live recordings or uploaded files, not just virtual calls?  
* Security and privacy: how is customer data handled on the platform?  
* Integrations: can it connect with your existing stack, like HubSpot, Notion, or Slack?  
* Functionality: does it go beyond transcriptions and actually help you take action?  
* Languages: can it transcribe and summarize meetings in different languages?  
* Desktop and mobile apps: can you access it on Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android for on-the-go meetings?  
* Recordings: is there support for saving and playing back audio and video recordings of meetings?    
## Evaluating Avoma and Fireflies.ai  
### Avoma
* Avoma provides accurate transcription with clear speaker labeling and AI summaries, while offering CRM integration and calendar syncing for workflow automation. The platform requires a paid subscription starting around $59-79 per user monthly, has no free tier, and presents a learning curve for new users due to feature complexity.

### Fireflies.ai
* Fireflies.ai works across major meeting platforms with automated summaries and task assignments, featuring keyword tracking and sentiment analysis with minimal setup required. The service has limited free tier offerings, achieves 90% transcription accuracy with some accent issues, and includes a feature-heavy interface that sends frequent email notifications.  
## Comparison table    
Avoma seems better suited for enterprise sales teams who need a structured approach and don't mind a steeper learning curve to get the most value. While it offers solid integrations with common business tools, its English-only limitation and lack of a free plan suggest it's targeting larger organizations with established processes and budgets.

Fireflies.ai appears designed for smaller teams or individual professionals who want a simpler, more accessible solution with multiple language support and a free tier to start with. Though it connects with popular productivity tools, like Avoma, it still leaves users wanting more comprehensive integration options and practical meeting assistance features.
