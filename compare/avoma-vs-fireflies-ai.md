# Avoma vs. Fireflies.ai – Which should you choose?  
AI meeting notes platforms provide four primary deliverables:  
  
* Transcripts create a word-for-word record of the meeting. For example, a one-hour product development meeting generates a searchable document containing every feature discussion, technical requirement, and team decision.  
* Action items are pulled directly from the conversation. When someone says "John will update the wireframes by Friday," the AI automatically creates a tracked task with the assignee and deadline.  
* Meeting summaries distill hour-long conversations into 2-3 paragraphs. A 45-minute sprint planning meeting becomes a concise overview of sprint goals, resource allocation, and key decisions.  
* Topic segmentation breaks discussions into labeled sections. A client call covering multiple projects is automatically divided into sections like "Website Redesign," "Q1 Marketing Campaign," and "Budget Review."  
  
In addition to the quality of these deliverables, we'll want to look at a number of other key factors:  
  
* Free trial: can you test it for free before committing?  
* Ease-of-use: does it have a simple, intuitive setup that works for non-technical users?  
* In-person meeting support: can it transcribe audio from live recordings or uploaded files, not just virtual calls?  
* Security and privacy: how is customer data handled on the platform?  
* Integrations: can it connect with your existing stack, like HubSpot, Notion, or Slack?  
* Functionality: does it go beyond transcriptions and actually help you take action?  
* Languages: can it transcribe and summarize meetings in different languages?  
* Desktop and mobile apps: can you access it on Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android for on-the-go meetings?  
* Recordings: is there support for saving and playing back audio and video recordings of meetings?    
## Evaluating Avoma and Fireflies.ai  
### Avoma
* Avoma provides transcription with 95% accuracy including jargon and accents, integrates with common business tools, and includes administrative task automation and note-taking features. The platform offers comprehensive meeting management capabilities, a free tier, and responsive customer support.
* The platform can be complex for basic transcription needs, occasionally experiences technical delays or speaker identification issues, and produces dense transcripts that can be difficult to skim. Higher tier pricing is expensive for small teams.

### Fireflies.ai
* Fireflies.ai offers straightforward meeting transcription with multi-language support, delivers quick post-meeting summaries with action items, and includes mobile access plus integrations with project management and CRM tools. The service includes a free tier and works across multiple platforms.
* The platform generates broad summaries that may miss nuanced details, struggles with heavy accents and technical terminology, and restricts advanced features like video recording to paid tiers. Users report interface complexity and excessive notifications as minor issues.  
## Comparison table    
Small sales teams and individual business owners would likely prefer Fireflies for its broader language support and simpler feature set focused on basic meeting capture and notes. The free tier with limited credits and straightforward CRM connections makes it accessible for teams just starting to formalize their meeting processes, though they may find themselves wanting more robust automation.

Larger organizations and enterprise sales teams would gravitate toward Avoma's automation engine and deeper workflow capabilities, especially for managing high-volume customer interactions. The built-in follow-up system and more extensive CRM automation could save significant time for busy teams, even if the integration ecosystem isn't quite as extensive as it could be for a tool at this level.
