# Avoma vs. Fireflies.ai – Which should you choose?  
AI meeting notes platforms provide four primary deliverables:  
  
* Transcripts create a word-for-word record of the meeting. For example, a one-hour product development meeting generates a searchable document containing every feature discussion, technical requirement, and team decision.  
* Action items are pulled directly from the conversation. When someone says "John will update the wireframes by Friday," the AI automatically creates a tracked task with the assignee and deadline.  
* Meeting summaries distill hour-long conversations into 2-3 paragraphs. A 45-minute sprint planning meeting becomes a concise overview of sprint goals, resource allocation, and key decisions.  
* Topic segmentation breaks discussions into labeled sections. A client call covering multiple projects is automatically divided into sections like "Website Redesign," "Q1 Marketing Campaign," and "Budget Review."  
  
In addition to the quality of these deliverables, we'll want to look at a number of other key factors:  
  
* Free trial: can you test it for free before committing?  
* Ease-of-use: does it have a simple, intuitive setup that works for non-technical users?  
* In-person meeting support: can it transcribe audio from live recordings or uploaded files, not just virtual calls?  
* Security and privacy: how is customer data handled on the platform?  
* Integrations: can it connect with your existing stack, like HubSpot, Notion, or Slack?  
* Functionality: does it go beyond transcriptions and actually help you take action?  
* Languages: can it transcribe and summarize meetings in different languages?  
* Desktop and mobile apps: can you access it on Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android for on-the-go meetings?  
* Recordings: is there support for saving and playing back audio and video recordings of meetings?    
## Evaluating Avoma and Fireflies.ai  
### Avoma
* Avoma provides accurate transcription with clear speaker labeling and AI summaries, while offering CRM integration and calendar syncing for workflow automation. The service requires paid plans starting around $59-79 per user monthly, has no free tier, and presents a learning curve for new users due to feature complexity.

### Fireflies.ai
* Fireflies.ai works across major meeting platforms with automated summaries and task assignments, featuring keyword tracking and sentiment analysis with minimal setup required. The free tier has strict limits, transcription accuracy can vary with accents, and the interface can feel overwhelming with frequent notification emails and numerous features to navigate.  
## Comparison table    
Fireflies.ai makes sense for small teams and freelancers who need basic meeting transcription and want to get started without paying upfront. The free plan and easy interface make it accessible for those who just need the basics, though its limited integration depth means you'll still be doing most of the post-meeting work manually.

Avoma is better suited for larger sales teams and enterprises who can justify the cost and training time. The more robust automation features and deeper (though still limited) integrations with CRM systems make it a better fit for organizations with established processes, even if it doesn't fully solve the challenge of turning meetings into actionable outcomes.
