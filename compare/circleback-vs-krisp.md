# Circleback vs. Krisp – Which should you choose?  
AI meeting notes platforms provide four primary deliverables:  
  
* Transcripts create a word-for-word record of the meeting. For example, a one-hour product development meeting generates a searchable document containing every feature discussion, technical requirement, and team decision.  
* Action items are pulled directly from the conversation. When someone says "John will update the wireframes by Friday," the AI automatically creates a tracked task with the assignee and deadline.  
* Meeting summaries distill hour-long conversations into 2-3 paragraphs. A 45-minute sprint planning meeting becomes a concise overview of sprint goals, resource allocation, and key decisions.  
* Topic segmentation breaks discussions into labeled sections. A client call covering multiple projects is automatically divided into sections like "Website Redesign," "Q1 Marketing Campaign," and "Budget Review."  
  
In addition to the quality of these deliverables, we'll want to look at a number of other key factors:  
  
* Free trial: can you test it for free before committing?  
* Ease-of-use: does it have a simple, intuitive setup that works for non-technical users?  
* In-person meeting support: can it transcribe audio from live recordings or uploaded files, not just virtual calls?  
* Security and privacy: how is customer data handled on the platform?  
* Integrations: can it connect with your existing stack, like HubSpot, Notion, or Slack?  
* Functionality: does it go beyond transcriptions and actually help you take action?  
* Languages: can it transcribe and summarize meetings in different languages?  
* Desktop and mobile apps: can you access it on Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android for on-the-go meetings?  
* Recordings: is there support for saving and playing back audio and video recordings of meetings?    
## Evaluating Circleback and Krisp  
### Circleback
* Circleback generates meeting notes within minutes and integrates with calendars, Slack and CRM systems. The tool focuses on core note-taking functionality and currently lacks video recording capabilities.

### Krisp
* Krisp combines noise cancellation with AI note-taking, offering audio cleanup and meeting summaries in one tool. The software has limitations including potential audio distortion, 60-minute daily limit on free plans, high CPU usage, and some users report slow customer support response times.  
## Comparison table    
Circleback seems best suited for larger teams and companies who need mobile access and want to automate their meeting workflows, though its limited integration set means you'll still be doing a lot manually. The addition of automation capabilities could be useful for teams who have regular meetings and want to reduce repetitive tasks, but the actual implementation falls short of truly solving meeting inefficiency.

Krisp appears designed for individual users and small teams who primarily work from desktop computers and need basic meeting tools, though the lack of mobile support and automation features makes it less versatile. While it handles the fundamentals well, its narrow scope of integrations means users will need additional tools to manage their complete meeting workflow effectively.
