# Circleback vs. Zoom AI – Which should you choose?  
AI meeting notes platforms provide four primary deliverables:  
  
* Transcripts create a word-for-word record of the meeting. For example, a one-hour product development meeting generates a searchable document containing every feature discussion, technical requirement, and team decision.  
* Action items are pulled directly from the conversation. When someone says "John will update the wireframes by Friday," the AI automatically creates a tracked task with the assignee and deadline.  
* Meeting summaries distill hour-long conversations into 2-3 paragraphs. A 45-minute sprint planning meeting becomes a concise overview of sprint goals, resource allocation, and key decisions.  
* Topic segmentation breaks discussions into labeled sections. A client call covering multiple projects is automatically divided into sections like "Website Redesign," "Q1 Marketing Campaign," and "Budget Review."  
  
In addition to the quality of these deliverables, we'll want to look at a number of other key factors:  
  
* Free trial: can you test it for free before committing?  
* Ease-of-use: does it have a simple, intuitive setup that works for non-technical users?  
* In-person meeting support: can it transcribe audio from live recordings or uploaded files, not just virtual calls?  
* Security and privacy: how is customer data handled on the platform?  
* Integrations: can it connect with your existing stack, like HubSpot, Notion, or Slack?  
* Functionality: does it go beyond transcriptions and actually help you take action?  
* Languages: can it transcribe and summarize meetings in different languages?  
* Desktop and mobile apps: can you access it on Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android for on-the-go meetings?  
* Recordings: is there support for saving and playing back audio and video recordings of meetings?    
## Evaluating Circleback and Zoom AI  
### Circleback
* Circleback provides automated meeting notes within minutes and integrates with calendars, Slack, and CRM systems. The tool focuses on core note-taking features and intentionally excludes video recording capabilities.

### Zoom AI
* Zoom AI operates within the Zoom platform, offering instant meeting summaries and action items at no extra cost for paid accounts. The tool has limited functionality outside Zoom meetings, basic chat integration, and occasional issues sharing notes externally.  
## Comparison table    
Small teams and startups that meet in person frequently will find Circleback more useful, since it works well for face-to-face meetings and offers a free trial to test it out. The automation features and broader integration set make it a decent choice for teams starting to formalize their meeting processes, though the integrations could go deeper.

Zoom AI makes more sense for remote-first companies already using Zoom who want to add some basic AI features to their existing workflow. While it handles the basics of meeting transcription and summary well enough, the limited automation capabilities and integration options mean teams will still need other tools to properly action their meeting outcomes.
