# Bluedot vs. Fireflies.ai – Which should you choose?  
AI meeting notes platforms provide four primary deliverables:  
  
* Transcripts create a word-for-word record of the meeting. For example, a one-hour product development meeting generates a searchable document containing every feature discussion, technical requirement, and team decision.  
* Action items are pulled directly from the conversation. When someone says "John will update the wireframes by Friday," the AI automatically creates a tracked task with the assignee and deadline.  
* Meeting summaries distill hour-long conversations into 2-3 paragraphs. A 45-minute sprint planning meeting becomes a concise overview of sprint goals, resource allocation, and key decisions.  
* Topic segmentation breaks discussions into labeled sections. A client call covering multiple projects is automatically divided into sections like "Website Redesign," "Q1 Marketing Campaign," and "Budget Review."  
  
In addition to the quality of these deliverables, we'll want to look at a number of other key factors:  
  
* Free trial: can you test it for free before committing?  
* Ease-of-use: does it have a simple, intuitive setup that works for non-technical users?  
* In-person meeting support: can it transcribe audio from live recordings or uploaded files, not just virtual calls?  
* Security and privacy: how is customer data handled on the platform?  
* Integrations: can it connect with your existing stack, like HubSpot, Notion, or Slack?  
* Functionality: does it go beyond transcriptions and actually help you take action?  
* Languages: can it transcribe and summarize meetings in different languages?  
* Desktop and mobile apps: can you access it on Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android for on-the-go meetings?  
* Recordings: is there support for saving and playing back audio and video recordings of meetings?    
## Evaluating Bluedot and Fireflies.ai  
### Bluedot
* Bluedot offers accurate transcription without requiring bot invites, works in background mode, and integrates with common apps for automatic note syncing across major meeting platforms. The tool requires Chrome for best results, has a 5-meeting free limit, locks advanced features behind paid tiers, and currently lacks mature mobile support.

### Fireflies.ai
* Fireflies.ai provides multi-platform support including mobile, offers a free tier, integrates with CRM and project tools, and delivers quick post-meeting summaries with action items. The tool struggles with accent recognition and technical terms, generates basic summaries that may miss nuance, and restricts video recording to paid tiers.  
## Comparison table    
Small teams and startups who need basic meeting tools will find Fireflies useful for capturing conversations on mobile devices and sharing notes. The lack of desktop apps and automation makes it most suitable for teams with simple needs who just want to record and transcribe.

Larger organizations needing more control and structure will gravitate toward Bluedot's desktop-first approach and automation capabilities. While its limited mobile support and basic integration set hold it back, the focus on desktop workflows makes it a better fit for companies with formal meeting processes.
