# Bluedot vs Fireflies.ai for meeting automation

Bluedot is an AI meeting recorder and note-taker delivered via Chrome extension. It works on all major meeting platforms like Zoom, Google Meet, and Microsoft Teams without requiring a bot to join calls. The tool records and transcribes meetings in real-time, supports over 100 languages, and integrates with common workflow tools like Salesforce, HubSpot, Notion, and Slack. Its key technical advantage is local recording capability that functions even when you're not the meeting host.

The service operates on a tiered pricing model with a limited free version (5 meetings total), and paid plans ranging from $14-40 per user/month depending on features needed. The Basic plan offers unlimited audio-only recordings with 1-hour maximums, while higher tiers add video recording, unlimited meeting length, custom templates, CRM integrations, and topic tracking. Bluedot works primarily on desktop Chrome browsers, with limited mobile support currently available.

Fireflies.ai is a cloud-based meeting assistant that joins calls as a bot participant to record, transcribe, and summarize discussions across platforms like Zoom, Teams, Google Meet, and Webex. It generates transcripts with speaker labels, provides an AI summary of key points and action items, and offers features such as keyword search and the AskFred chatbot for querying meeting content. The tool works across various meeting platforms, supports over 100 languages, offers mobile apps for iOS and Android, and integrates with tools like Slack, Asana, and CRM systems.

The service is structured in tiers, starting with a free plan that includes limited monthly meeting credits, while paid plans range from $10/user/month (Pro) to $19/user/month (Business) with additional features like video recording and advanced analytics. Users can record in-person meetings via the mobile app and upload offline files for transcription. While Fireflies doesn't have a desktop app, it operates through a web interface and Chrome extension, with its AI assistant joining calls from the cloud.

## Comparing Bluedot and Fireflies.ai

### Bluedot

* Bluedot offers high-accuracy transcription through a Chrome extension that works without adding a bot to meetings. The service limits free usage to just 5 total meetings, essentially functioning as a trial, making it primarily a paid solution from the start. While it integrates with key apps like Notion and Salesforce, these integrations lack depth and don't fully bridge the gap between capturing meeting data and actual productivity improvements.

### Fireflies.ai

* Fireflies.ai functions by joining meetings as a participant bot and transcribing content in real-time across various platforms. It provides a genuinely free tier with monthly limits rather than a lifetime cap, but struggles with accurately transcribing accented speech or technical jargon. Despite numerous integrations with project management tools and CRMs, these connections remain superficial, rarely translating meeting insights into measurable workflow enhancements.

| Feature | Bluedot | Fireflies.ai |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| Recording method | Local extension | ❌ Cloud bot |
| Free tier | ❌ 5 meetings total | ✅ Monthly allowance |
| Pricing | $14-40/month | $10-19/month |

| Mobile support | ❌ None | ✅ iOS/Android |
| In-person meetings | ✅ Supported | ✅ Supported |
| Integration depth | ❌ Limited utility | ❌ Basic connections |
| Automation | ✅ Email/tasks | ❌ Basic CRM logging |

Bluedot appears best suited for privacy-conscious teams and those who value transcription accuracy above all else. Its local recording approach that doesn't require adding a bot makes it ideal for sales teams handling sensitive client calls or researchers needing precise transcripts, despite its higher price point and lack of mobile options.

Fireflies.ai better serves teams with tight budgets who need a simple solution that works across devices. Its genuine free tier and mobile apps make it accessible for smaller organizations or individuals tracking occasional meetings, though teams with international participants or those discussing specialized topics may find its transcription shortcomings frustrating.

## Bluedot vs Fireflies.ai: What do users say?

Based on user reviews, Bluedot is praised primarily for its accurate transcription capabilities, with many users considering it "the most accurate" AI meeting notes tool they've used. Users appreciate that it doesn't require adding a bot to meetings, allowing for discreet background recording even when you're not the host. The seamless integration with popular apps like Salesforce, HubSpot, Notion, and Slack is frequently highlighted as a significant advantage, automating the process of updating meeting notes across platforms. However, users note that the free version is extremely limited (only 5 meetings lifetime), and the pricing at higher tiers is relatively steep. Some also mention that the best experience requires Chrome on desktop, which can be limiting for organizations using other browsers or needing mobile support.

Fireflies.ai receives positive feedback for its ease of setup and time-saving capabilities. Users report good transcription quality, even for languages beyond English, and appreciate how it delivers summaries and action items within minutes after calls end. The availability of a mobile app and its compatibility across multiple platforms, plus the existence of a free tier, make it accessible to many users. Integration with project management and CRM tools is highlighted as beneficial for team workflows. On the downside, some users desire more concise or nuanced summaries, noting that Fireflies tends to generate high-level overviews that sometimes miss the original tone. Transcription accuracy can suffer with heavy accents or technical jargon, and some users find the interface cluttered or complain about excessive email notifications.
