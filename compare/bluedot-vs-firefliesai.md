# Bluedot vs Fireflies.ai – Feature and product comparison

Here's what you should look for in an AI meeting automation tool:  
* Transcripts that create a word-for-word record of the meeting. For example, a one-hour product development meeting generates a searchable document containing every feature discussion, technical requirement, and team decision.
* [Action items](/releases/add-action-items-to-meetings) are pulled directly from the conversation. When someone says "John will update the wireframes by Friday," the AI automatically creates a tracked task with the assignee and deadline.
* Meeting summaries distill hour-long conversations into 2-3 paragraphs. A 45-minute sprint planning meeting becomes a concise overview of sprint goals, resource allocation, and key decisions.
* Topic segmentation breaks discussions into labeled sections. A client call covering multiple projects is automatically divided into sections like "Website Redesign," "Q1 Marketing Campaign," and "Budget Review."

## Other key features
In addition to the quality of these deliverables, we'll want to look at a number of other key factors:
* Ease-of-use: does it have a simple, intuitive setup that works for non-technical users?
* In-person meeting support: can it transcribe audio from live recordings or uploaded files, not just virtual calls?
* Security and privacy: how is customer data handled on the platform?
* Integrations: can it connect with your existing stack, like HubSpot, Notion, or Slack?
* Functionality: does it go beyond transcriptions and actually help you take action?
* Languages: can it transcribe and summarize meetings in different languages?
* Desktop and mobile apps: can you access it on Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android for on-the-go meetings?

## Understanding Bluedot and Fireflies.ai
Bluedot is an AI meeting recorder and note-taker delivered via Chrome extension. It works on all major meeting platforms like Zoom, Google Meet, and Microsoft Teams without requiring a bot to join calls. The tool records and transcribes meetings in real-time, supports over 100 languages, and integrates with common workflow tools like Salesforce, HubSpot, Notion, and Slack. Its key technical advantage is local recording capability that functions even when you're not the meeting host.

The service operates on a tiered pricing model with a limited free version (5 meetings total), and paid plans ranging from $14-40 per user/month depending on features needed. The Basic plan offers unlimited audio-only recordings with 1-hour maximums, while higher tiers add video recording, unlimited meeting length, custom templates, CRM integrations, and topic tracking. Bluedot works primarily on desktop Chrome browsers, with limited mobile support currently available.

Fireflies.ai is a cloud-based meeting assistant that joins calls as a bot participant to record, transcribe, and summarize discussions across platforms like Zoom, Teams, Google Meet, and Webex. It generates transcripts with speaker labels, provides an AI summary of key points and action items, and offers features such as keyword search and the AskFred chatbot for querying meeting content. The tool works across various meeting platforms, supports over 100 languages, offers mobile apps for iOS and Android, and integrates with tools like Slack, Asana, and CRM systems.

The service is structured in tiers, starting with a free plan that includes limited monthly meeting credits, while paid plans range from $10/user/month (Pro) to $19/user/month (Business) with additional features like video recording and advanced analytics. Users can record in-person meetings via the mobile app and upload offline files for transcription. While Fireflies doesn't have a desktop app, it operates through a web interface and Chrome extension, with its AI assistant joining calls from the cloud.

## Comparing Bluedot and Fireflies.ai

### Bluedot

* Bluedot offers high-accuracy transcription through a Chrome extension that works without adding a bot to meetings. The service limits free usage to just 5 total meetings, essentially functioning as a trial, making it primarily a paid solution from the start. While it integrates with key apps like Notion and Salesforce, these integrations lack depth and don't fully bridge the gap between capturing meeting data and actual productivity improvements.

### Fireflies.ai

* Fireflies.ai functions by joining meetings as a participant bot and transcribing content in real-time across various platforms. It provides a genuinely free tier with monthly limits rather than a lifetime cap, but struggles with accurately transcribing accented speech or technical jargon. Despite numerous integrations with project management tools and CRMs, these connections remain superficial, rarely translating meeting insights into measurable workflow enhancements.

| Feature | Bluedot | Fireflies.ai |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| Recording method | Local extension | ❌ Cloud bot |
| Free tier | ❌ 5 meetings total | ✅ Monthly allowance |
| Pricing | $14-40/month | $10-19/month |
| Transcription accuracy | ✅ High precision | ❌ Accent challenges |
| Mobile support | ❌ None | ✅ iOS/Android |
| In-person meetings | ✅ Supported | ✅ Supported |
| Integration depth | ❌ Limited utility | ❌ Basic connections |
| Automation | ✅ Email/tasks | ❌ Basic CRM logging |

Bluedot appears best suited for privacy-conscious teams and those who value transcription accuracy above all else. Its local recording approach that doesn't require adding a bot makes it ideal for sales teams handling sensitive client calls or researchers needing precise transcripts, despite its higher price point and lack of mobile options.

Fireflies.ai better serves teams with tight budgets who need a simple solution that works across devices. Its genuine free tier and mobile apps make it accessible for smaller organizations or individuals tracking occasional meetings, though teams with international participants or those discussing specialized topics may find its transcription shortcomings frustrating.
