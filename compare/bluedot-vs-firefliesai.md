# Bluedot vs Fireflies.ai for meeting automation

Bluedot is an AI meeting recorder and note-taker delivered via Chrome extension. It works on all major meeting platforms like Zoom, Google Meet, and Microsoft Teams without requiring a bot to join calls. The tool records and transcribes meetings in real-time, supports over 100 languages, and integrates with common workflow tools like Salesforce, HubSpot, Notion, and Slack. Its key technical advantage is local recording capability that functions even when you're not the meeting host.

The service operates on a tiered pricing model with a limited free version (5 meetings total), and paid plans ranging from $14-40 per user/month depending on features needed. The Basic plan offers unlimited audio-only recordings with 1-hour maximums, while higher tiers add video recording, unlimited meeting length, custom templates, CRM integrations, and topic tracking. Bluedot works primarily on desktop Chrome browsers, with limited mobile support currently available.

Fireflies.ai is a cloud-based meeting assistant that joins calls as a bot participant to record, transcribe, and summarize discussions across platforms like Zoom, Teams, Google Meet, and Webex. It generates transcripts with speaker labels, provides an AI summary of key points and action items, and offers features such as keyword search and the AskFred chatbot for querying meeting content. The tool works across various meeting platforms, supports over 100 languages, offers mobile apps for iOS and Android, and integrates with tools like Slack, Asana, and CRM systems.

The service is structured in tiers, starting with a free plan that includes limited monthly meeting credits, while paid plans range from $10/user/month (Pro) to $19/user/month (Business) with additional features like video recording and advanced analytics. Users can record in-person meetings via the mobile app and upload offline files for transcription. While Fireflies doesn't have a desktop app, it operates through a web interface and Chrome extension, with its AI assistant joining calls from the cloud.

## Comparing Bluedot and Fireflies.ai

### Bluedot

* Bluedot offers high-accuracy transcription through a Chrome extension that works without adding a bot to meetings. The service limits free usage to just 5 total meetings, essentially functioning as a trial, making it primarily a paid solution from the start. While it integrates with key apps like Notion and Salesforce, these integrations lack depth and don't fully bridge the gap between capturing meeting data and actual productivity improvements.

### Fireflies.ai

* Fireflies.ai functions by joining meetings as a participant bot and transcribing content in real-time across various platforms. It provides a genuinely free tier with monthly limits rather than a lifetime cap, but struggles with accurately transcribing accented speech or technical jargon. Despite numerous integrations with project management tools and CRMs, these connections remain superficial, rarely translating meeting insights into measurable workflow enhancements.

Bluedot appears best suited for privacy-conscious teams and those who value transcription accuracy above all else. Its local recording approach that doesn't require adding a bot makes it ideal for sales teams handling sensitive client calls or researchers needing precise transcripts, despite its higher price point and lack of mobile options.

Fireflies.ai better serves teams with tight budgets who need a simple solution that works across devices. Its genuine free tier and mobile apps make it accessible for smaller organizations or individuals tracking occasional meetings, though teams with international participants or those discussing specialized topics may find its transcription shortcomings frustrating.

## Bluedot vs Fireflies.ai: What do users say?

Bluedot is highly regarded as an AI meeting recorder and note-taker that functions via a Chrome extension without requiring a meeting bot. Users particularly praise its transcription accuracy, with many claiming it's "the most accurate" AI notetaker they've tried. Its discreet background recording capability is appreciated as it doesn't require inviting a bot to meetings and works even when you're not the host. Bluedot's extensive integration capabilities allow automatic updates to popular apps like Salesforce, HubSpot, Notion, and Slack. However, its free version is limited to just 5 lifetime meetings, essentially functioning as a trial. The tool works best with Chrome on desktop, with less robust mobile and desktop app support, and higher-tier plans can be relatively expensive for small teams.

Fireflies.ai operates as a cloud-based AI meeting assistant that joins meetings to record, transcribe, and summarize discussions. Users appreciate its ease of setup, time-saving capabilities, and good transcription quality even in languages beyond English. The tool delivers summaries and bullet-point action items shortly after calls, which professionals find valuable for follow-ups. Fireflies offers a mobile app and works across many platforms with a free tier available. However, some users desire more nuanced summaries, as Fireflies tends to generate high-level overviews that may lose original phrasing or tone. Transcription accuracy can decrease with heavy accents or technical jargon, and advanced features are limited in the free plan.
