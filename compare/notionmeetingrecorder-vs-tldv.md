# Notion Meeting Recorder vs TLDV for meeting automation

Notion Meeting Recorder is a tool that captures meetings directly within Notion workspaces, recording audio from either virtual or in-person conversations. It transcribes meetings in real-time, then generates an organized summary with key points and action items that live as a Notion page. The feature works via a simple /meet command or through Notion calendar links, and can be triggered on desktop or mobile devices. All content becomes fully searchable afterward within Notion and supports 16 languages for transcription and summaries.

The tool records audio locally through your device (no meeting bot required), making it compatible with any meeting platform or in-person discussions. It's part of the Notion AI add-on, which costs $10 per member monthly ($8 if billed annually) on top of any Notion plan. While it integrates deeply within the Notion ecosystem for tasks and projects, it doesn't offer native integrations to external tools like CRMs. The functionality assumes users are already embedded in Notion for their workflow.

TLDV is a meeting tool that records, transcribes, and summarizes conversations with AI. It offers timestamps, highlights, and integrates with CRMs and workplace tools, including HubSpot, Notion, Salesforce and thousands of others. The software runs on Windows and macOS desktop apps, where it can locally record Zoom and Microsoft Teams meetings, and supports over 30 languages.

The service follows a tiered pricing model with a free plan, Pro ($18/month) and Business ($59/month) options. While users praise its accurate transcriptions, intuitive interface, and generous free tier, TLDV has limitations - it doesn't support in-person meetings, lacks a mobile app, has limited platform compatibility, depends on internet quality, and raises some privacy concerns for certain users.

## Comparing Notion Meeting Recorder and TLDV

### Notion Meeting Recorder

* Notion Meeting Recorder integrates AI note-taking directly within the Notion workspace, enabling automatic transcription and summarization of meetings. While it excels at keeping all information centralized in Notion, it requires users to already be invested in the Notion ecosystem to realize its full potential.
* The tool records meetings locally through device audio and works for both virtual and in-person meetings with no need for a meeting bot. Though it offers basic integrations with Notion's internal systems, it lacks robust third-party integrations, limiting its usefulness for teams who rely on external tools for task management.

### TLDV

* TLDV provides AI meeting recording with transcription, summarization, and CRM integration capabilities across multiple platforms. While it offers extensive third-party integrations including HubSpot and Salesforce, it falls short on supporting in-person meetings and lacks mobile app functionality.
* The service includes AI agents for automated recording and note-taking with support for over 30 languages. Despite its comprehensive feature set, TLDV remains limited in its ability to truly streamline post-meeting workflows or drive meaningful action from captured information.

| In-person meetings | ✅ | ❌ |
| Local recording | ✅ | ✅ |

Notion Meeting Recorder is best suited for teams already invested in the Notion ecosystem who need a seamless way to keep meeting notes and action items within their existing workspace. Its strength lies in its integration with Notion's database and task management features, making it valuable for small to medium teams who manage most of their workflow within Notion. However, the additional cost and limited external integrations might be dealbreakers for those who work across multiple platforms.

TLDV would better serve sales and customer success teams who rely heavily on CRM systems and need detailed meeting records. With its broader language support and extensive third-party integrations, it's positioned for enterprises working across different tools and systems. However, the lack of in-person meeting support and mobile apps restricts its flexibility, making it less ideal for hybrid or field-based teams who need to capture conversations on the go.

## Notion Meeting Recorder vs TLDV: What do users say?

Notion Meeting Recorder and TLDV are both AI-powered meeting transcription tools with distinct features and user experiences. Notion's Meeting Recorder integrates seamlessly within the Notion workspace, allowing users to record, transcribe, and summarize meetings with AI-generated action items directly in their existing workflow. Users particularly appreciate this integration, calling Notion the "ultimate digital workspace" with well-integrated AI features that eliminate context switching. The tool saves time by automatically extracting key points and action items, though it works best for teams already committed to the Notion ecosystem. Some users note there's a learning curve if you're not already using Notion extensively, and the AI feature requires a paid add-on ($10/month per user). Notion supports in-person meetings through local recording via device microphones, works with 16 languages, and offers both desktop and mobile apps.

TLDV, by comparison, focuses specifically on meeting recording with accurate transcriptions and an intuitive interface. Users praise its generous free plan alongside paid tiers ($18/month Pro, $59/month Business). While TLDV doesn't support in-person meetings, it offers local recording via desktop apps for platforms like Zoom and Teams. It stands out with its extensive integration options, connecting to HubSpot, Notion, Salesforce, and thousands of other tools. TLDV supports over 30 languages but lacks a native mobile app, which some users find limiting.
