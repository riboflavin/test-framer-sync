# Notion Meeting Recorder vs Bluedot for meeting automation

Notion Meeting Recorder is an AI note-taking feature that works directly within Notion workspaces. It records and transcribes meetings (both virtual and in-person) using device microphones or system audio, then automatically generates organized summaries with key points and action items. The tool works across all major meeting platforms without requiring a meeting bot, and supports 16 languages for transcription. Users access it via a /meet command or through calendar integration, with all content stored searchably in Notion.

The feature requires Notion's AI add-on ($10/user/month or $8/user/month annually), which can be applied to any Notion plan including the free tier. It functions on desktop apps (Windows/Mac), web browsers, and mobile apps, though desktop is recommended for capturing system audio. The tool is designed specifically for the Notion ecosystem, meaning it integrates deeply with Notion's databases and pages but lacks native external integrations beyond what Notion's API provides.

## Bluedot

Bluedot is an AI meeting recorder that works as a Chrome extension to capture conversations in Zoom, Teams, and Google Meet without requiring a bot participant. It transcribes meetings in real-time across 100+ languages, then generates summaries and action items from the content. The system records locally through your device, which means it works even when you're not the meeting host and can function for in-person meetings.

The tool integrates with various platforms including Notion, Slack, HubSpot, Salesforce, and Google Docs, allowing automatic syncing of meeting notes. Bluedot offers a limited free version (5 meetings), with paid tiers ranging from $18/month for basic features to $40/month for business capabilities including CRM integrations and topic tracking. It currently functions primarily through Chrome on desktop, with no mobile app available.

## Comparing Notion Meeting Recorder and Bluedot

### Notion Meeting Recorder

* Notion Meeting Recorder functions as an integrated note-taking tool within the Notion ecosystem, requiring no external bots while capturing meeting content directly in your workspace. Its value is limited for non-Notion users, as the system heavily depends on existing Notion infrastructure for organizing and actioning meeting outputs.
* The recorder captures meetings via local audio recording and transcription across both desktop and mobile platforms, supporting 16 languages with automatic summary generation. While it offers basic integrations through Notion's database system, it lacks robust third-party connections and falls short in providing actionable follow-through beyond the Notion environment.

### Bluedot

* Bluedot operates as a standalone meeting recorder with Chrome extension functionality that captures meetings across major platforms without requiring bot participation, though with limited free usage. It focuses on transcription accuracy but requires payment for meaningful ongoing use, with higher tiers becoming relatively expensive.
* The tool offers wider third-party integrations than Notion's recorder, connecting with CRMs and productivity tools like Slack and Google Drive. Despite supporting 100+ languages and providing desktop applications, it lacks mobile support and, like Notion, doesn't fully deliver on helping users execute meeting outcomes beyond basic note organization.

| External integrations | ❌ | ✅ |
| Language support | 16 languages | 100+ languages |

Notion Meeting Recorder works best for teams already invested in the Notion ecosystem who need straightforward meeting capture without switching contexts. Its value proposition centers on integration with existing Notion workflows, making it ideal for teams who manage projects, documents, and databases within Notion. Teams seeking basic meeting documentation without complex integration needs will find it sufficient, though limited outside the Notion environment.

Bluedot serves teams needing more sophisticated cross-platform integration regardless of their primary workspace tool. Its strength lies in connecting meeting content to various productivity tools and CRMs, making it better suited for sales teams, researchers, and organizations with complex tool ecosystems. The higher price point reflects this wider integration capability, though users must weigh whether these connections justify the cost versus simpler alternatives.

## Notion Meeting Recorder vs Bluedot: What do users say?

Notion Meeting Recorder and Bluedot offer AI-powered meeting transcription and note-taking solutions with different strengths. Notion's solution integrates directly within the Notion workspace, allowing users to record meetings through a simple /meet command and have them automatically transcribed, summarized, and organized with key points and action items. Users particularly appreciate how it eliminates context switching, as all meeting notes live within Notion alongside other work documents. The main drawbacks are that it requires Notion adoption to be truly effective, comes as a paid add-on ($10/month per user), and lacks standalone functionality. Bluedot, meanwhile, operates as a Chrome extension that works across platforms like Zoom, Meet, and Teams without requiring a bot to join meetings. It stands out for its transcription accuracy across 100+ languages and robust integrations with tools like Slack, Notion, HubSpot, and Salesforce. However, Bluedot's free tier is very limited (only 5 meetings total), and it has relatively steep pricing for higher tiers ($18-40/user/month). Both tools support in-person meetings and local recording, but Bluedot lacks mobile app support while Notion offers it.
