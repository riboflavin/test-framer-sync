# Fireflies.ai vs Granola for meeting automation

Fireflies.ai is an AI meeting assistant that joins calls as a participant to record and transcribe conversations across platforms like Zoom, Teams, and Google Meet. The system provides searchable transcripts with speaker identification, generates summaries with action items, and offers an AskFred chatbot for querying meeting content. It integrates with tools like Slack, Asana, and CRM systems to facilitate follow-ups, and can be used for team knowledge sharing, sales call analysis, and personal note-taking.

The service offers multiple tiers: a free plan with limited credits, a Pro plan (~$10/user/month) with unlimited audio recording, and a Business plan (~$19/user/month) adding video recording and analytics. Fireflies supports over 100 languages, works for in-person meetings via a mobile app, and allows local recording. While it offers good transcription accuracy, users note it sometimes struggles with accents and technical jargon, and some find the AI summaries too high-level or the interface cluttered.

Granola is an AI notepad for meetings that runs locally on Mac computers. It captures system audio from any meeting platform without requiring a bot participant, allowing users to jot minimal notes during calls. After meetings, it produces structured summaries with sections like key takeaways and next steps based on the audio recording and user notes. The app features customizable note templates and an AI assistant for follow-up content generation.

The tool works offline on Mac with local recording and transcription in about 16 languages. Pricing starts with a 25-meeting free trial, followed by an $18/month individual plan or $14/user/month for business teams. Current limitations include Mac-only support (no Windows version), no mobile apps yet, limited integrations (calendar sync and some Notion/HubSpot capabilities), and no advanced workflow automation.

## Comparing Fireflies.ai and Granola

### Fireflies.ai
* Fireflies.ai uses a cloud-based bot that joins meetings to record, transcribe and summarize discussions across various platforms. The tool offers integrations with CRMs and task managers but lacks depth in helping users truly action meeting outcomes.

### Granola
* Granola runs locally on Mac computers, capturing system audio without needing a bot participant in meetings. While it provides customizable templates and a clean interface, it falls short in integration capabilities and doesn't offer robust workflows to help implement meeting decisions.

The AI assistant joins meetings across platforms like Zoom and Teams, delivering summaries and action items within minutes after calls.

## FAQs 
• Would Fireflies.ai work for in-person meetings? What about Granola?

• What do users say about the quality of transcriptions?
For Fireflies.ai, users report good transcription quality, even in other languages like Dutch. However, some note that transcription accuracy can decrease with heavy accents or technical jargon, with reviewers mentioning misidentified speakers or missed slang.
