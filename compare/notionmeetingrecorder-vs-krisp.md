# Notion Meeting Recorder vs Krisp for meeting automation

Notion Meeting Recorder is a feature that lets users record and transcribe meetings directly within Notion workspaces. It captures audio from virtual or in-person meetings, then automatically generates organized summaries with key points and action items when the meeting ends. The tool works via a /meet command or through calendar events, and can operate on desktop and mobile devices across 16 languages, functioning with any meeting platform by recording audio through the device rather than using a bot.

The feature requires the Notion AI add-on, which costs $10 per member monthly (or $8 if billed annually) on top of any Notion plan. It integrates deeply with Notion's ecosystem, placing meeting notes directly into relevant pages and databases where they become searchable and actionable, but doesn't offer native integrations to push content to external platforms. While it works well for recording and organizing meeting information, it's primarily designed for teams already using Notion rather than as a standalone solution.

## Krisp

Krisp is an audio enhancement tool that operates as a noise cancellation filter across communication apps, removing background sounds like dog barks, keyboard typing, and echo during calls. It expanded functionality to include meeting recording, transcription, and AI summaries that automatically capture key points and action items. The software works as an intermediary audio layer that processes sound in real-time on Windows and Mac computers.

The service offers a free plan with 60 minutes of daily noise cancellation and two meeting summaries, while paid tiers ($8-15/month) provide unlimited usage. Krisp can record both virtual and in-person meetings, transcribes in over 90 languages, integrates with calendar systems and HubSpot CRM, and processes audio locally rather than requiring a meeting bot. Though it offers a desktop application, Krisp discontinued its mobile app and occasionally experiences audio distortion or high CPU usage.

## Comparing Notion Meeting Recorder and Krisp

### Notion Meeting Recorder
* Integrates directly into Notion, recording and transcribing meetings with AI-generated summaries and action items. Operates within the existing workspace, allowing seamless connection to other Notion elements without switching contexts.
* Limited value outside the Notion ecosystem, requiring users to build their workspace setup to maximize benefits. The feature depends on device audio capture rather than a meeting bot, which may cause reliability issues in some environments.

### Krisp
* Combines noise cancellation technology with meeting transcription and summaries, functioning across communication platforms without requiring specific integrations. Records locally through its desktop application without needing a bot participant.
* Resource-intensive operation can affect system performance, with occasional audio distortion affecting transcription quality. Limited to desktop use for AI notes (no mobile app support), and integrations remain basic despite HubSpot connectivity.

Notion Meeting Recorder works best for teams already embedded in the Notion ecosystem who want their meeting insights directly connected to their workspace. Its primary advantage is the contextual integration with existing Notion elements, though it falls short for teams using diverse toolsets who need stronger external integrations.

Krisp serves users who prioritize audio quality and broad language support regardless of their productivity platform. Its noise cancellation differentiates it from Notion, making it ideal for those in noisy environments, but its limited automation capabilities and lack of mobile support restrict its utility for teams needing comprehensive meeting workflow solutions.

## Notion Meeting Recorder vs Krisp: What do users say?

Notion Meeting Recorder and Krisp both offer AI-powered meeting transcription and note-taking capabilities, but with different approaches and strengths. Notion integrates its meeting recording directly into its workspace, making it ideal for teams already using Notion. Users appreciate that notes live directly in their workflow without context switching, calling it the "ultimate digital workspace." The tool saves time by generating summaries and action items automatically. However, critics note it's not plug-and-play outside the Notion ecosystem, requiring some setup and configuration. As an add-on to Notion at $10/user/month, some find the additional cost difficult to justify on top of existing plan fees.

Krisp began as a noise cancellation tool and expanded to include meeting transcription and summaries. Users consistently praise its "just works" approach to removing background noise from calls. Its AI note-taking feature generates summaries with key points and action items that users find "extremely accurate." Downsides include occasional audio distortion, limited free tier usage (60 minutes/day), and some reports of high CPU usage. Pricing ranges from free (limited) to Pro ($8/month) with unlimited features, to Business plans for larger teams.

Both tools support in-person meetings via local recording and work across multiple platforms, though Krisp has discontinued its mobile app while Notion maintains mobile support. Krisp offers more extensive language support (90+ languages) compared to Notion (16 languages).

## FAQs 
• Would Notion Meeting Recorder work for in-person meetings? What about Krisp?
Yes, both Notion Meeting Recorder and Krisp work for in-person meetings. Notion can capture in-person discussions using your device's microphone, working "with every meeting tool" including face-to-face meetings. Similarly, Krisp captures any conversation (online or offline) using noise-canceling audio on your device.

• What about meeting bots? Does either of these tools require a meeting bot?
Neither tool requires a meeting bot. Notion AI Meeting Notes records audio locally from your computer without inserting a bot participant - "no meeting bot required." It captures system output and microphone input directly. Similarly, Krisp "records & transcribes meetings locally via the Krisp app (no bot; works with any voice app)."

• What do users say about the quality of transcriptions?
For Notion, while users praise the summaries and action-item generation, the context doesn't specifically mention transcription quality feedback. For Krisp, users note the AI summaries with key points and action items were "extremely accurate," requiring minimal edits. However, some report audio quirks where Krisp might distort the speaker's voice or clip words, especially when canceling very loud noises, which "can affect transcription accuracy."
