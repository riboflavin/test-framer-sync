# Fireflies.ai vs Krisp for meeting automation

Fireflies.ai is a cloud-based AI meeting assistant that joins online meetings as a participant to record, transcribe, and summarize discussions. It works across major platforms like Zoom, Teams, and Google Meet, offering searchable transcripts with speaker labels and AI-generated summaries of key points and action items. The system includes an AskFred chatbot for querying meeting content and integrates with tools like Slack, Asana, and CRM systems for workflow enhancement.

The service operates on a tiered pricing model, with a free plan offering limited monthly credits, and paid plans starting around $10/user/month for unlimited audio recording and a set number of AI summaries. It supports over 100 languages, offers mobile apps for recording in-person meetings, and allows offline file uploads for transcription. While the transcription quality is generally good, accuracy can decrease with heavy accents or technical jargon, and some users report that the AI-generated summaries sometimes lack nuance or detail.

Krisp is an AI voice enhancement tool that operates as a real-time noise cancellation system, removing background sounds and echo from microphone or speaker output across communication apps. It has expanded to include meeting assistance features, recording and transcribing calls while generating structured summaries with key points and tasks. The application functions by acting as an audio filter that works with virtually all communication platforms, making it suitable for remote workers, call centers, and anyone needing clearer audio and automatic meeting documentation.

The software offers a free plan with 60 minutes daily of noise cancellation and limited meeting summaries, while paid tiers provide unlimited usage starting at $8/month. Krisp works with both online meetings and in-person conversations, recording locally via its desktop application for Windows and Mac. It supports transcription in over 90 languages and offers calendar integration plus HubSpot CRM connectivity, though it lacks a mobile app for its meeting assistant features.

## Comparing Fireflies.ai and Krisp

### Fireflies.ai

* Fireflies uses a bot to join and transcribe meetings across platforms, creating searchable transcripts and AI summaries. It integrates with some productivity tools but lacks depth in helping users actually implement meeting outcomes beyond basic logging.
* The mobile app allows in-person recording and the platform supports many languages, making it accessible for diverse teams. However, the lack of a desktop application and limited automation capabilities restrict its utility for turning meeting content into actionable workflows.

### Krisp

* Krisp combines noise-cancellation technology with meeting transcription and summarization, focusing first on audio quality and second on content capture. Despite some useful features, it falls short on robust integrations that would help users implement decisions from their meetings.
* The desktop app provides local recording without needing a bot, improving privacy and reliability. However, the discontinued mobile support and minimal automation features limit its effectiveness as a comprehensive solution for translating meeting insights into completed tasks.

Fireflies.ai works better for teams who regularly hold virtual meetings across different platforms and need to maintain a searchable repository of discussions. Its bot-based approach and mobile support make it ideal for organizations with distributed teams who need to capture and share meeting knowledge without worrying about technical setup.

Krisp is more suitable for individuals working in noisy environments who prioritize audio clarity alongside note-taking. Its local recording approach offers better privacy and works with any voice application, making it a good fit for professionals who take many calls through different platforms and want noise reduction as their primary feature with meeting notes as a bonus.

## Fireflies.ai vs Krisp: What do users say?

User reviews of Fireflies.ai highlight its effectiveness as a cloud-based AI meeting assistant that joins calls to record, transcribe, and summarize discussions across multiple platforms. Users appreciate its ease of setup, accurate transcription capabilities (even in languages like Dutch), and quick delivery of summaries with action items after calls. The mobile app and integrations with project management and CRM tools are also valued features. However, some users note that summaries can be overly high-level, transcription accuracy decreases with heavy accents or technical jargon, and the free plan limits advanced features. Some find the interface cluttered or receive too many notifications.

Krisp reviews focus on its dual functionality as both a noise cancellation tool and meeting assistant. Users consistently praise its ability to effectively remove background noise during calls, making it indispensable for remote workers in noisy environments. The newer AI note-taking feature has been well-received, with users noting the accuracy of summaries containing key points and action items. On the downside, some users report occasional audio distortion, limited free plan usage (60 minutes daily), high CPU usage, and pricing concerns if they only need one feature set. Customer support receives mixed reviews.
