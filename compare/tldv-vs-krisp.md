# tldv vs Krisp for meeting automation

tldv is a meeting tool that records, transcribes, and summarizes conversations. It attaches timestamps to content, allows highlighting of important segments, and integrates with CRM systems. The software employs AI agents to handle recording, note-taking, and CRM logging tasks, supporting over 30 languages through its Windows and macOS desktop applications.

The platform offers tiered pricing with a free plan, Pro at $18/month, and Business at $59/month. While it provides local recording capabilities for Zoom and Microsoft Teams, it lacks native mobile apps and in-person recording functionality. The system integrates with HubSpot, Notion, Salesforce, and thousands of other services, though its performance depends on internet connection quality and it faces platform support limitations.

Krisp is an AI voice enhancement tool that functions as both a noise cancellation system and meeting assistant. It removes background noises and echo in real-time across communication apps by acting as an audio filter layer. The software has expanded to include meeting recording, transcription, and AI-generated summaries with key points and action items. It works with virtually all voice applications and supports transcription in over 90 languages through its desktop app for Windows and Mac.

The service offers a free plan with 60 minutes of daily noise cancellation and 2 meeting summaries, while paid tiers (starting at $8/month) provide unlimited usage. Some users report occasional audio distortion or word clipping, particularly with very loud background noise, and the app can consume significant CPU resources. Krisp integrates with calendar systems for one-click recording and can push meeting summaries to HubSpot CRM, though it lacks a mobile app for the meeting assistant features.

## Comparing tldv and Krisp

### tldv

* tldv offers recording, transcription and AI summaries with CRM integration, but lacks in-person recording capability and mobile apps. Its platform support is limited and quality depends on internet connection, reducing its utility for users in varied environments or with connectivity issues.

### Krisp

* Krisp combines noise cancellation with meeting transcription and summaries, working across communication platforms while supporting in-person conversations. Despite impressive language support and local recording capabilities, its limited integrations and automation features don't fully streamline post-meeting workflows.

tldv works best for teams already deep in the CRM ecosystem who need meeting insights integrated with their existing tools. The higher price point makes sense for sales teams and customer success managers who need to capture and analyze customer conversations at scale, though they'll need good internet connections.

Krisp fits individual professionals working in noisy environments who value clear communication and basic meeting records. Its noise cancellation technology gives it a distinctive advantage for remote workers in distracting settings, though both tools fall short in truly making meetings actionable through robust integration and automation systems.
