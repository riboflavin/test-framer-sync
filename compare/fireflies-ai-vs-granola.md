# Fireflies.ai vs. Granola: Which should you choose?
AI meeting notes platforms provide four primary deliverables:

• Transcripts create a word-for-word record of the meeting. For example, a one-hour product development meeting generates a searchable document containing every feature discussion, technical requirement, and team decision.
• Action items are pulled directly from the conversation. When someone says "John will update the wireframes by Friday," the AI automatically creates a tracked task with the assignee and deadline.
• Meeting summaries distill hour-long conversations into 2-3 paragraphs. A 45-minute sprint planning meeting becomes a concise overview of sprint goals, resource allocation, and key decisions.
• Topic segmentation breaks discussions into labeled sections. A client call covering multiple projects is automatically divided into sections like "Website Redesign," "Q1 Marketing Campaign," and "Budget Review."

In addition to the quality of these deliverables, we'll want to look at a number of other key factors:

• Free trial: can you test it for free before committing?
• Ease-of-use: does it have a simple, intuitive setup that works for non-technical users?
• In-person meeting support: can it transcribe audio from live recordings or uploaded files, not just virtual calls?
• Security and privacy: how is customer data handled on the platform?
• Integrations: can it connect with your existing stack, like HubSpot, Notion, or Slack?
• Functionality: does it go beyond transcriptions and actually help you take action?
• Languages: can it transcribe and summarize meetings in different languages?
• Desktop and mobile apps: can you access it on Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android for on-the-go meeitngs?
• Recordings: is there support for saving and playing back audio and video recordings of meetings?
## Evaluating Fireflies.ai and Granola
Fireflies.ai: Users appreciate its wide compatibility with various platforms and detailed meeting summaries with action items. The feature-rich tool offers insights through keywords, sentiment analysis, and task assignments. However, users note limitations of the free plan, transcription accuracy issues, cluttered UI, and excessive email notifications.

Granola: Users like its minimal and user-friendly interface, which resembles a regular notepad. The app does not require a meeting bot and offers custom templates for tailored summaries. However, it is currently only available on MacOS, lacks integrations, and is designed for individual note-taking without multi-user features. The product is still evolving, with some basic capabilities like editing transcripts.

Fireflies.ai might appeal to tech-savvy individuals or companies looking for a tool with Zoom and calendar integration, multiple language support, and an automation engine. However, it falls short in terms of in-person meeting support and local recording capabilities. Granola, on the other hand, could be suitable for those who prioritize ease of use, local recording, and in-person meetings, but it lacks depth in integrations with platforms like HubSpot and Notion, as well as an automation engine.

Both Fireflies.ai and Granola have limitations in their depth of integrations and may not fully meet the needs of users seeking comprehensive solutions for managing meetings effectively.
