# Fireflies.ai vs. Granola – Which should you choose?  
AI meeting notes platforms provide four primary deliverables:  
  
* Transcripts create a word-for-word record of the meeting. For example, a one-hour product development meeting generates a searchable document containing every feature discussion, technical requirement, and team decision.  
* Action items are pulled directly from the conversation. When someone says "John will update the wireframes by Friday," the AI automatically creates a tracked task with the assignee and deadline.  
* Meeting summaries distill hour-long conversations into 2-3 paragraphs. A 45-minute sprint planning meeting becomes a concise overview of sprint goals, resource allocation, and key decisions.  
* Topic segmentation breaks discussions into labeled sections. A client call covering multiple projects is automatically divided into sections like "Website Redesign," "Q1 Marketing Campaign," and "Budget Review."  
  
In addition to the quality of these deliverables, we'll want to look at a number of other key factors:  
  
* Free trial: can you test it for free before committing?  
* Ease-of-use: does it have a simple, intuitive setup that works for non-technical users?  
* In-person meeting support: can it transcribe audio from live recordings or uploaded files, not just virtual calls?  
* Security and privacy: how is customer data handled on the platform?  
* Integrations: can it connect with your existing stack, like HubSpot, Notion, or Slack?  
* Functionality: does it go beyond transcriptions and actually help you take action?  
* Languages: can it transcribe and summarize meetings in different languages?  
* Desktop and mobile apps: can you access it on Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android for on-the-go meetings?  
* Recordings: is there support for saving and playing back audio and video recordings of meetings?    
## Evaluating Fireflies.ai and Granola  
### Fireflies.ai
* Fireflies.ai captures meeting content with good transcription quality in multiple languages and delivers summaries with action items quickly after calls, integrates with project management tools, and offers a mobile app with a free tier. The platform works across many devices and meeting platforms, making it useful for distributed teams.
* The tool sometimes produces overly general summaries that miss nuanced details, struggles with heavy accents and technical terms, and gates key features like video recording behind paid tiers. Users report interface clutter and excessive notifications as minor issues.

### Granola
* Granola automatically captures meeting notes in the background and produces organized summaries that can be customized via templates, featuring a minimal interface and unobtrusive recording process. The tool focuses on letting users stay present in conversations while handling note creation afterward.
* The platform currently only works on Mac devices, lacks a mobile app, and requires system audio capture to function properly. Some users note occasional bugs and missing features typical of newer software.  
## Comparison table    
Fireflies.ai seems built for sales teams and customer success folks who spend their days jumping between in-person and remote meetings, and need their conversations synced to CRM tools. The mobile app and broad integration support helps these users stay productive on the go, though the integrations themselves could be deeper and more actionable.

Granola appears designed for individual professionals and small teams who prefer a simple desktop tool for their remote meetings, and don't need complex integrations or mobile access. The local-first approach and straightforward feature set works well for basic meeting capture, though users might wish for more help turning their recordings into actual next steps and outcomes.
