# Fireflies.ai vs. Granola – Which should you choose?  
AI meeting notes platforms provide four primary deliverables:  
  
* Transcripts create a word-for-word record of the meeting. For example, a one-hour product development meeting generates a searchable document containing every feature discussion, technical requirement, and team decision.  
* Action items are pulled directly from the conversation. When someone says "John will update the wireframes by Friday," the AI automatically creates a tracked task with the assignee and deadline.  
* Meeting summaries distill hour-long conversations into 2-3 paragraphs. A 45-minute sprint planning meeting becomes a concise overview of sprint goals, resource allocation, and key decisions.  
* Topic segmentation breaks discussions into labeled sections. A client call covering multiple projects is automatically divided into sections like "Website Redesign," "Q1 Marketing Campaign," and "Budget Review."  
  
In addition to the quality of these deliverables, we'll want to look at a number of other key factors:  
  
* Free trial: can you test it for free before committing?  
* Ease-of-use: does it have a simple, intuitive setup that works for non-technical users?  
* In-person meeting support: can it transcribe audio from live recordings or uploaded files, not just virtual calls?  
* Security and privacy: how is customer data handled on the platform?  
* Integrations: can it connect with your existing stack, like HubSpot, Notion, or Slack?  
* Functionality: does it go beyond transcriptions and actually help you take action?  
* Languages: can it transcribe and summarize meetings in different languages?  
* Desktop and mobile apps: can you access it on Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android for on-the-go meetings?  
* Recordings: is there support for saving and playing back audio and video recordings of meetings?

## Comparison table    
Some individuals or organizations may find Fireflies.ai appealing due to its integration with Zoom and calendars, as well as its automation engine. However, it lacks depth in integrations with other tools and may not be the most effective in facilitating in-person meetings or local recordings. On the other hand, Granola could be suitable for those looking for an easy-to-use tool with desktop app support, but its limited integrations and lack of an automation engine might hinder its ability to enhance meeting productivity.

Both Fireflies.ai and Granola offer free plans with certain limitations, making them accessible options for users to try out. However, users seeking comprehensive integrations and features to streamline their meeting processes may find these tools falling short in providing the depth needed to truly enhance their meeting experiences and productivity.
