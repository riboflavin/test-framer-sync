# Fireflies.ai vs. Granola – Which should you choose?  
AI meeting notes platforms provide four primary deliverables:  
  
* Transcripts create a word-for-word record of the meeting. For example, a one-hour product development meeting generates a searchable document containing every feature discussion, technical requirement, and team decision.  
* Action items are pulled directly from the conversation. When someone says "John will update the wireframes by Friday," the AI automatically creates a tracked task with the assignee and deadline.  
* Meeting summaries distill hour-long conversations into 2-3 paragraphs. A 45-minute sprint planning meeting becomes a concise overview of sprint goals, resource allocation, and key decisions.  
* Topic segmentation breaks discussions into labeled sections. A client call covering multiple projects is automatically divided into sections like "Website Redesign," "Q1 Marketing Campaign," and "Budget Review."  
  
In addition to the quality of these deliverables, we'll want to look at a number of other key factors:  
  
* Free trial: can you test it for free before committing?  
* Ease-of-use: does it have a simple, intuitive setup that works for non-technical users?  
* In-person meeting support: can it transcribe audio from live recordings or uploaded files, not just virtual calls?  
* Security and privacy: how is customer data handled on the platform?  
* Integrations: can it connect with your existing stack, like HubSpot, Notion, or Slack?  
* Functionality: does it go beyond transcriptions and actually help you take action?  
* Languages: can it transcribe and summarize meetings in different languages?  
* Desktop and mobile apps: can you access it on Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android for on-the-go meetings?  
* Recordings: is there support for saving and playing back audio and video recordings of meetings?    
## Evaluating Fireflies.ai and Granola  
### Fireflies.ai
* Fireflies.ai integrates with major meeting platforms through a bot, provides automated summaries with action items, and includes features like keyword tracking, sentiment analysis, and task assignments. The system requires minimal setup and sends post-meeting emails with transcripts and key points.
* The service has usage limits on free plans, achieves 90% transcription accuracy with some accent/jargon issues, includes a feature-heavy interface that takes time to learn, and sends frequent email notifications that can be excessive for users with many meetings.

### Granola
* Granola functions as a simple notepad that records meetings through device audio without requiring a bot, supports custom note templates, and provides transcription to supplement manual notes. The app operates independently of meeting platforms and focuses on individual note-taking.
* The application currently only works on MacOS, has limited integration options with other tools, lacks multi-user collaboration features, and maintains basic functionality for transcript editing and other features as a new product.  
## Comparison table    
Fireflies.ai makes sense for remote-first companies who live in Zoom and need basic integrations with their existing tools, though they'll likely need additional software to turn their meeting insights into actual work output. The tool works well enough for teams who speak different languages and need to access their recordings from any device, but don't require sophisticated meeting workflows.

Granola fits best for Mac users who have frequent in-person meetings and want to capture high-quality local recordings without relying on cloud services or complex setups. While it's simpler and more focused than Fireflies, it lacks the integration depth that most modern teams need to properly manage their meeting information and follow-up tasks.
