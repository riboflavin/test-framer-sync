# Fireflies.ai vs. Granola: Which should you choose?  
AI meeting notes platforms provide four primary deliverables:  
  
* Transcripts create a word-for-word record of the meeting. For example, a one-hour product development meeting generates a searchable document containing every feature discussion, technical requirement, and team decision.  
* Action items are pulled directly from the conversation. When someone says "John will update the wireframes by Friday," the AI automatically creates a tracked task with the assignee and deadline.  
* Meeting summaries distill hour-long conversations into 2-3 paragraphs. A 45-minute sprint planning meeting becomes a concise overview of sprint goals, resource allocation, and key decisions.  
* Topic segmentation breaks discussions into labeled sections. A client call covering multiple projects is automatically divided into sections like "Website Redesign," "Q1 Marketing Campaign," and "Budget Review."  
  
In addition to the quality of these deliverables, we'll want to look at a number of other key factors:  
  
* Free trial: can you test it for free before committing?  
* Ease-of-use: does it have a simple, intuitive setup that works for non-technical users?  
* In-person meeting support: can it transcribe audio from live recordings or uploaded files, not just virtual calls?  
* Security and privacy: how is customer data handled on the platform?  
* Integrations: can it connect with your existing stack, like HubSpot, Notion, or Slack?  
* Functionality: does it go beyond transcriptions and actually help you take action?  
* Languages: can it transcribe and summarize meetings in different languages?  
* Desktop and mobile apps: can you access it on Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android for on-the-go meetings?  
* Recordings: is there support for saving and playing back audio and video recordings of meetings?    
## Evaluating Fireflies.ai and Granola  
- Fireflies.ai: Pros - Wide compatibility with various platforms, detailed summaries and action items, feature-rich for deeper insights, easy setup. Cons - Free plan limitations, transcription accuracy issues, cluttered UI with slight learning curve, excessive email notifications.
- Granola: Pros - Minimal and user-friendly app, no meeting bot required, custom templates for tailored summaries, accurate transcription quality. Cons - MacOS only with Windows version pending, limited integrations, lacks multi-user features, still adding basic capabilities as a new product.

| Zoom & Calendar Integration       | ✅ Yes                | ❌ No                  |
| Easy to Use?                      | ✅ Generally easy     | ✅ Super easy         |
| Good for In-Person Meetings?      | ❌ No                 | ✅ Yes                |
| Good for Local Recording?         | ❌ No                 | ✅ Yes                |
| Integrates with HubSpot, Notion, etc.? | ✅ Yes           | ❌ No                  |
| Automation Engine?                | ✅ Yes                | ❌ No                  |
| Language Support                  | ✅ Multiple languages | ❌ English only       |
| Desktop App                       | ❌ No (Web-based)     | ✅ Yes (Mac-only)     |
| iPhone & Android Apps             | ✅ Yes (Both)         | ❌ No                 |  
- Fireflies.ai might appeal to individuals or companies looking for a tool with Zoom and calendar integration, as well as support for multiple languages. However, it falls short in terms of in-person meeting support and local recording capabilities. Additionally, its depth of integrations may not be as extensive as desired.

- Granola could be suitable for users seeking a super easy-to-use tool with a free trial option and Mac desktop app availability. Nevertheless, it lacks integration with popular platforms like HubSpot and Notion, and its English-only language support may limit its appeal. Users may find that both tools have limitations in helping them effectively manage and conduct meetings.
