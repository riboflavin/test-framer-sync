# Zoom AI vs. Krisp – Which should you choose?  
AI meeting notes platforms provide four primary deliverables:  
  
* Transcripts create a word-for-word record of the meeting. For example, a one-hour product development meeting generates a searchable document containing every feature discussion, technical requirement, and team decision.  
* Action items are pulled directly from the conversation. When someone says "John will update the wireframes by Friday," the AI automatically creates a tracked task with the assignee and deadline.  
* Meeting summaries distill hour-long conversations into 2-3 paragraphs. A 45-minute sprint planning meeting becomes a concise overview of sprint goals, resource allocation, and key decisions.  
* Topic segmentation breaks discussions into labeled sections. A client call covering multiple projects is automatically divided into sections like "Website Redesign," "Q1 Marketing Campaign," and "Budget Review."  
  
In addition to the quality of these deliverables, we'll want to look at a number of other key factors:  
  
* Free trial: can you test it for free before committing?  
* Ease-of-use: does it have a simple, intuitive setup that works for non-technical users?  
* In-person meeting support: can it transcribe audio from live recordings or uploaded files, not just virtual calls?  
* Security and privacy: how is customer data handled on the platform?  
* Integrations: can it connect with your existing stack, like HubSpot, Notion, or Slack?  
* Functionality: does it go beyond transcriptions and actually help you take action?  
* Languages: can it transcribe and summarize meetings in different languages?  
* Desktop and mobile apps: can you access it on Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android for on-the-go meetings?  
* Recordings: is there support for saving and playing back audio and video recordings of meetings?

## Comparison table    
Some individuals or organizations may find Zoom AI appealing due to its native integration with Zoom and ease of use. However, those seeking deeper integrations with tools like HubSpot or Notion may be disappointed by its limitations. Similarly, Krisp's free plan and support for multiple languages could attract users, but its lack of integrations and limited functionality for in-person meetings may hinder its usefulness for some.

Both Zoom AI and Krisp fall short in terms of integrations with popular tools and their ability to enhance productivity during meetings. While Zoom AI offers native Zoom integration and ease of use, it lacks support for integrations with platforms like HubSpot and Notion. On the other hand, Krisp's free plan and language support may be appealing, but its limitations in facilitating in-person meetings and local recording could be drawbacks for users looking for a comprehensive solution.
