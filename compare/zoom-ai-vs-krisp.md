# Zoom AI vs. Krisp – Which should you choose?  
AI meeting notes platforms provide four primary deliverables:  
  
* Transcripts create a word-for-word record of the meeting. For example, a one-hour product development meeting generates a searchable document containing every feature discussion, technical requirement, and team decision.  
* Action items are pulled directly from the conversation. When someone says "John will update the wireframes by Friday," the AI automatically creates a tracked task with the assignee and deadline.  
* Meeting summaries distill hour-long conversations into 2-3 paragraphs. A 45-minute sprint planning meeting becomes a concise overview of sprint goals, resource allocation, and key decisions.  
* Topic segmentation breaks discussions into labeled sections. A client call covering multiple projects is automatically divided into sections like "Website Redesign," "Q1 Marketing Campaign," and "Budget Review."  
  
In addition to the quality of these deliverables, we'll want to look at a number of other key factors:  
  
* Free trial: can you test it for free before committing?  
* Ease-of-use: does it have a simple, intuitive setup that works for non-technical users?  
* In-person meeting support: can it transcribe audio from live recordings or uploaded files, not just virtual calls?  
* Security and privacy: how is customer data handled on the platform?  
* Integrations: can it connect with your existing stack, like HubSpot, Notion, or Slack?  
* Functionality: does it go beyond transcriptions and actually help you take action?  
* Languages: can it transcribe and summarize meetings in different languages?  
* Desktop and mobile apps: can you access it on Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android for on-the-go meetings?  
* Recordings: is there support for saving and playing back audio and video recordings of meetings?    
## Evaluating Zoom AI and Krisp  
### Zoom AI
* Zoom AI integrates natively with Zoom meetings, providing real-time Q&A, whiteboard AI for diagrams, and meeting assistance with no additional setup required for paid Zoom subscribers. The system has limitations including Zoom-platform exclusivity, paid subscription requirements, inability to capture non-logged-in speakers, and lack of custom vocabulary for industry terminology.

### Krisp
* Krisp works across all meeting platforms and phone calls, offering noise cancellation, unlimited transcription, and custom vocabulary support with a free tier available. The tool has constraints including daily usage limits on the free plan, basic summary capabilities, no multi-user features, and can be resource-intensive during extended meetings.  
## Comparison table    
Zoom AI makes sense for companies already using Zoom who want simple meeting summaries and don't need to support multiple languages or in-person meetings. The tight Zoom integration is nice but the lack of a free plan and limited third-party tool connections means you're mostly stuck in the Zoom ecosystem.

Krisp works better for individuals or teams who need flexibility across different meeting types and languages, plus want a free tier to start with. While it handles both online and offline meetings well, it still lacks meaningful integrations with common work tools and doesn't help automate post-meeting workflows.
