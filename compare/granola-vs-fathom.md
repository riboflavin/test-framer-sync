# Granola vs. Fathom – Which should you choose?  
AI meeting notes platforms provide four primary deliverables:  
  
* Transcripts create a word-for-word record of the meeting. For example, a one-hour product development meeting generates a searchable document containing every feature discussion, technical requirement, and team decision.  
* Action items are pulled directly from the conversation. When someone says "John will update the wireframes by Friday," the AI automatically creates a tracked task with the assignee and deadline.  
* Meeting summaries distill hour-long conversations into 2-3 paragraphs. A 45-minute sprint planning meeting becomes a concise overview of sprint goals, resource allocation, and key decisions.  
* Topic segmentation breaks discussions into labeled sections. A client call covering multiple projects is automatically divided into sections like "Website Redesign," "Q1 Marketing Campaign," and "Budget Review."  
  
In addition to the quality of these deliverables, we'll want to look at a number of other key factors:  
  
* Free trial: can you test it for free before committing?  
* Ease-of-use: does it have a simple, intuitive setup that works for non-technical users?  
* In-person meeting support: can it transcribe audio from live recordings or uploaded files, not just virtual calls?  
* Security and privacy: how is customer data handled on the platform?  
* Integrations: can it connect with your existing stack, like HubSpot, Notion, or Slack?  
* Functionality: does it go beyond transcriptions and actually help you take action?  
* Languages: can it transcribe and summarize meetings in different languages?  
* Desktop and mobile apps: can you access it on Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android for on-the-go meetings?  
* Recordings: is there support for saving and playing back audio and video recordings of meetings?    
## Evaluating Granola and Fathom  
### Granola
* Granola functions as a device-level note-taking tool that works across any platform without needing meeting bots, offering custom templates and local transcription with the ability to manually share notes after meetings. The tool is currently MacOS-only with limited integrations and basic editing features, lacking multi-user collaboration and mobile support.

### Fathom
* Fathom provides transcription and summarization for meetings with multi-language support and free core features, primarily focused on post-meeting documentation and analysis. The platform has historically been Zoom-focused with some team usage limitations, requiring paid plans for advanced features and lacking real-time collaborative editing.  
## Comparison table    
Small teams and freelancers who primarily do in-person meetings or need local recordings would find Granola useful, though they'll need to handle follow-up tasks manually. The Mac-only desktop app and English-only support limit its reach, but its simplicity makes it accessible for basic meeting capture needs.

Remote teams and companies heavily invested in Zoom would benefit more from Fathom's web-based approach and existing integrations with common business tools. Its support for multiple languages and mobile apps makes it more versatile for distributed teams, though like Granola, it lacks meaningful automation to help users act on what happens in meetings.
