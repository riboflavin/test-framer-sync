# Granola vs. Fathom: Which should you choose?
AI meeting notes platforms provide four primary deliverables:

• Transcripts create a word-for-word record of the meeting. For example, a one-hour product development meeting generates a searchable document containing every feature discussion, technical requirement, and team decision.
• Action items are pulled directly from the conversation. When someone says "John will update the wireframes by Friday," the AI automatically creates a tracked task with the assignee and deadline.
• Meeting summaries distill hour-long conversations into 2-3 paragraphs. A 45-minute sprint planning meeting becomes a concise overview of sprint goals, resource allocation, and key decisions.
• Topic segmentation breaks discussions into labeled sections. A client call covering multiple projects is automatically divided into sections like "Website Redesign," "Q1 Marketing Campaign," and "Budget Review."

In addition to the quality of these deliverables, we'll want to look at a number of other key factors:

• Free trial: can you test it for free before committing?
• Ease-of-use: does it have a simple, intuitive setup that works for non-technical users?
• In-person meeting support: can it transcribe audio from live recordings or uploaded files, not just virtual calls?
• Security and privacy: how is customer data handled on the platform?
• Integrations: can it connect with your existing stack, like HubSpot, Notion, or Slack?
• Functionality: does it go beyond transcriptions and actually help you take action?
• Languages: can it transcribe and summarize meetings in different languages?
• Desktop and mobile apps: can you access it on Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android for on-the-go meeitngs?
• Recordings: is there support for saving and playing back audio and video recordings of meetings?
## Evaluating Granola and Fathom
Granola: Users appreciate its minimal, user-friendly interface and accurate transcription quality. However, it is currently limited to MacOS, lacks integrations, and does not support multi-user collaboration.

Fathom: Users praise its top-notch accuracy in transcripts and free unlimited usage for core features. However, it was historically Zoom-only, has some duplicate note issues, and lacks live collaboration features.

Granola might appeal to individuals or small businesses looking for a simple and free tool to manage their meetings, especially if they prioritize ease of use and in-person meeting capabilities. However, its lack of integrations with popular platforms like Zoom and limited automation features may hinder its usefulness for more complex meeting needs.

Fathom could be a better fit for larger companies or teams seeking a free tool with broader integration options, such as Zoom and calendar support, as well as multi-language support. Yet, its absence of in-person meeting features and a desktop app, along with limited automation capabilities, might limit its effectiveness in truly streamlining meeting processes for users.
