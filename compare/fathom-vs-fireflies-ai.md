# Fathom vs. Fireflies.ai – Which should you choose?  
AI meeting notes platforms provide four primary deliverables:  
  
* Transcripts create a word-for-word record of the meeting. For example, a one-hour product development meeting generates a searchable document containing every feature discussion, technical requirement, and team decision.  
* Action items are pulled directly from the conversation. When someone says "John will update the wireframes by Friday," the AI automatically creates a tracked task with the assignee and deadline.  
* Meeting summaries distill hour-long conversations into 2-3 paragraphs. A 45-minute sprint planning meeting becomes a concise overview of sprint goals, resource allocation, and key decisions.  
* Topic segmentation breaks discussions into labeled sections. A client call covering multiple projects is automatically divided into sections like "Website Redesign," "Q1 Marketing Campaign," and "Budget Review."  
  
In addition to the quality of these deliverables, we'll want to look at a number of other key factors:  
  
* Free trial: can you test it for free before committing?  
* Ease-of-use: does it have a simple, intuitive setup that works for non-technical users?  
* In-person meeting support: can it transcribe audio from live recordings or uploaded files, not just virtual calls?  
* Security and privacy: how is customer data handled on the platform?  
* Integrations: can it connect with your existing stack, like HubSpot, Notion, or Slack?  
* Functionality: does it go beyond transcriptions and actually help you take action?  
* Languages: can it transcribe and summarize meetings in different languages?  
* Desktop and mobile apps: can you access it on Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android for on-the-go meetings?  
* Recordings: is there support for saving and playing back audio and video recordings of meetings?    
## Evaluating Fathom and Fireflies.ai  
### Fathom
* Fathom offers quick transcription and AI summaries within seconds of meetings ending, with a generous free tier and multiple summary formats. The interface is simple and works for live meetings only, with no external audio upload support or mobile app.

### Fireflies.ai
* Fireflies.ai provides transcription across multiple languages, generates summaries with action items, and integrates with project management tools and CRM systems. The system sometimes produces overly general summaries, struggles with accents and technical terms, and gates advanced features like video recording behind paid tiers.  
## Comparison table    
Fathom makes sense for remote-first teams and companies who need desktop software and want to automate what happens after meetings, though its lack of mobile apps and in-person capabilities limit its use. The tool works well for distributed teams who primarily use Zoom and need basic integrations with tools like HubSpot and Notion.

Fireflies.ai fits better for hybrid teams who need to record both in-person and remote meetings, and who want mobile access to their recordings and notes. While it offers more language support and integrations with major platforms like Salesforce, its web-only interface and partial automation capabilities may not satisfy teams looking for deeper workflow automation.
