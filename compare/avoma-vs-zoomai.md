# Avoma vs Zoom AI – Feature and product comparison

AI meeting notes platforms provide four primary deliverables:
* Transcripts that create a word-for-word record of the meeting. For example, a one-hour product development meeting generates a searchable document containing every feature discussion, technical requirement, and team decision.
* Action items are pulled directly from the conversation. When someone says "John will update the wireframes by Friday," the AI automatically creates a tracked task with the assignee and deadline.
* Meeting summaries distill hour-long conversations into 2-3 paragraphs. A 45-minute sprint planning meeting becomes a concise overview of sprint goals, resource allocation, and key decisions.
* Topic segmentation breaks discussions into labeled sections. A client call covering multiple projects is automatically divided into sections like "Website Redesign," "Q1 Marketing Campaign," and "Budget Review."

In addition to the quality of these deliverables, we'll want to look at a number of other key factors:
* Ease-of-use: does it have a simple, intuitive setup that works for non-technical users?
* In-person meeting support: can it transcribe audio from live recordings or uploaded files, not just virtual calls?
* Security and privacy: how is customer data handled on the platform?
* Integrations: can it connect with your existing stack, like HubSpot, Notion, or Slack?
* Functionality: does it go beyond transcriptions and actually help you take action?
* Languages: can it transcribe and summarize meetings in different languages?
* Desktop and mobile apps: can you access it on Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android for on-the-go meetings?

## About Avoma
Avoma is an AI meeting assistant that records, transcribes, and summarizes meetings. It breaks notes into organized topics like pain points and next steps, captures action items, and syncs with CRMs including Salesforce and HubSpot. The platform includes features for agenda templates, live note collaboration, and automated call logging. It's designed for sales and customer success teams but serves broader meeting productivity needs.

The system offers transcription with about 95% accuracy even with accents or jargon, and integrates with tools like Zoom, Slack, and calendar apps. Avoma provides multiple tiers starting with a free plan (limited to approximately 10 meetings monthly), with paid options ranging from $19 to $129 per user per month. It supports over 20 languages, works for both online and in-person meetings through its mobile app, but lacks a dedicated desktop application.

## About Zoom AI
## Zoom AI

Zoom AI is built directly into the Zoom platform, providing automated meeting summaries and next-action items after calls. It allows participants to ask questions during meetings (like "What did I miss?") and get real-time answers. The system also helps with composing emails, chats, and creating meeting-related documents. It's included at no additional cost for Zoom paid subscribers.

The tool only works for virtual Zoom meetings and can't capture in-person conversations independently. While it offers live transcription in over 30 languages, its integration capabilities are limited to Zoom's ecosystem with few native connections to external tools. The AI features are accessible through Zoom clients on desktop and mobile devices, but aren't available to free Zoom plan users beyond limited trial access.

## Comparison
### Avoma

* Avoma functions as a platform for recording, transcribing, and summarizing meetings with organized notes by topic. It offers agenda templates and CRM integration but lacks deeper workflow integrations that would help users truly capitalize on meeting insights.

* Users appreciate Avoma's accuracy and time-saving capabilities, along with its broad integration ecosystem with platforms like Zoom and HubSpot. However, the platform can be excessive for basic needs, with some users reporting bugs and delays that limit its practical utility.

### Zoom AI

* Zoom AI provides built-in features that generate meeting summaries and action items directly within Zoom calls, allowing participants to ask questions during meetings. While convenient, it suffers from limited functionality outside the Zoom ecosystem and lacks the integration depth needed for comprehensive meeting management.

* The tool integrates seamlessly with Zoom and requires no additional setup, generating summaries almost instantly after meetings. Yet its usefulness is restricted to Zoom meetings only, with limited external integrations that prevent users from maximizing their meeting productivity across different workflows.

| Feature | Avoma | Zoom AI |
|---------|-------|---------|
| In-person meetings | ✓ | ❌ |
| Local recording | ✓ | Partial |
| CRM integrations | Limited | Very limited |
| Automation | Basic | Minimal |
| Language support | ✓ | ✓ |
| Desktop app | ❌ | ✓ |
| Mobile apps | ✓ | ✓ |
| Pricing | $19-129/user | Included w/Zoom |

Avoma makes more sense for sales teams and organizations that conduct meetings across multiple platforms and need comprehensive meeting intelligence. Its CRM integration capabilities, though limited, offer more value for teams tracking customer interactions, though users should be prepared for a steeper price point and more complex setup process.

Zoom AI is better suited for teams already invested in the Zoom ecosystem who need basic meeting summaries without additional costs. It's the simpler option for organizations with straightforward needs, though they'll need to accept its platform limitations and lack of cross-platform functionality. Neither tool fully addresses the challenge of turning meeting insights into actionable workflow items.
