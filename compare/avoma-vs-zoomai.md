# Avoma vs Zoom AI for meeting automation

Avoma is an AI meeting assistant that records, transcribes, and summarizes meetings. It breaks notes into organized topics like pain points and next steps, captures action items, and syncs with CRMs including Salesforce and HubSpot. The platform includes features for agenda templates, live note collaboration, and automated call logging. It's designed for sales and customer success teams but serves broader meeting productivity needs.

The system offers transcription with about 95% accuracy even with accents or jargon, and integrates with tools like Zoom, Slack, and calendar apps. Avoma provides multiple tiers starting with a free plan (limited to approximately 10 meetings monthly), with paid options ranging from $19 to $129 per user per month. It supports over 20 languages, works for both online and in-person meetings through its mobile app, but lacks a dedicated desktop application.

## Zoom AI

Zoom AI is built directly into the Zoom platform, providing automated meeting summaries and next-action items after calls. It allows participants to ask questions during meetings (like "What did I miss?") and get real-time answers. The system also helps with composing emails, chats, and creating meeting-related documents. It's included at no additional cost for Zoom paid subscribers.

The tool only works for virtual Zoom meetings and can't capture in-person conversations independently. While it offers live transcription in over 30 languages, its integration capabilities are limited to Zoom's ecosystem with few native connections to external tools. The AI features are accessible through Zoom clients on desktop and mobile devices, but aren't available to free Zoom plan users beyond limited trial access.

## Comparing Avoma and Zoom AI

### Avoma

* Avoma functions as a platform for recording, transcribing, and summarizing meetings with organized notes by topic. It offers agenda templates and CRM integration but lacks deeper workflow integrations that would help users truly capitalize on meeting insights.

* Users appreciate Avoma's accuracy and time-saving capabilities, along with its broad integration ecosystem with platforms like Zoom and HubSpot. However, the platform can be excessive for basic needs, with some users reporting bugs and delays that limit its practical utility.

### Zoom AI

* Zoom AI provides built-in features that generate meeting summaries and action items directly within Zoom calls, allowing participants to ask questions during meetings. While convenient, it suffers from limited functionality outside the Zoom ecosystem and lacks the integration depth needed for comprehensive meeting management.

* The tool integrates seamlessly with Zoom and requires no additional setup, generating summaries almost instantly after meetings. Yet its usefulness is restricted to Zoom meetings only, with limited external integrations that prevent users from maximizing their meeting productivity across different workflows.

| Feature | Avoma | Zoom AI |
|---------|-------|---------|
| In-person meetings | ✓ | ❌ |
| Local recording | ✓ | Partial |
| CRM integrations | Limited | Very limited |
| Automation | Basic | Minimal |
| Language support | ✓ | ✓ |
| Desktop app | ❌ | ✓ |
| Mobile apps | ✓ | ✓ |
| Pricing | $19-129/user | Included w/Zoom |

Avoma makes more sense for sales teams and organizations that conduct meetings across multiple platforms and need comprehensive meeting intelligence. Its CRM integration capabilities, though limited, offer more value for teams tracking customer interactions, though users should be prepared for a steeper price point and more complex setup process.

Zoom AI is better suited for teams already invested in the Zoom ecosystem who need basic meeting summaries without additional costs. It's the simpler option for organizations with straightforward needs, though they'll need to accept its platform limitations and lack of cross-platform functionality. Neither tool fully addresses the challenge of turning meeting insights into actionable workflow items.

## Avoma vs Zoom AI: What do users say?

Avoma and Zoom AI Companion offer contrasting approaches to AI meeting assistance. Based on user reviews, Avoma is praised as an all-in-one solution for recording, transcribing, and summarizing meetings with approximately 95% accuracy even with jargon or accents. Users particularly appreciate how it saves time on administrative tasks and offers strong integration with platforms like Zoom, HubSpot, and Slack. However, some find it potentially overwhelming for individual users or simple needs, with occasional bugs and delays reported. Avoma offers a free plan with limited features, with paid tiers ranging from $19 to $129 per user monthly.

Zoom AI Companion, by contrast, is highlighted for its seamless integration within the Zoom platform, requiring no additional setup for existing Zoom users. Reviews note its extreme ease of use, with almost instant generation of meeting summaries and action items. The tool is included at no extra cost for paid Zoom subscribers, making it cost-effective. However, limitations include its exclusivity to the Zoom platform, basic integration with Zoom Chat, and occasional difficulties in sharing AI notes outside of Zoom. Users also mention that some features feel less developed compared to dedicated meeting tools.

## FAQs 
• Would Avoma work for in-person meetings? What about Zoom AI?
Yes, Avoma works for in-person meetings. It has a mobile app that can record offline/in-person meetings for later transcription. Zoom AI does not work for in-person meetings as it only works for virtual Zoom calls and cannot independently capture in-person audio.

• What about meeting bots? Does either of these tools require a meeting bot?
Avoma has a meeting bot that joins calls, and some users report occasional issues where "the bot sometimes joins a meeting late." For Zoom AI, there's no mention of a separate meeting bot as the AI functionality appears to be built directly into the Zoom platform.

• What do users say about the quality of transcriptions?
Avoma's transcriptions are highly rated for accuracy - users report they are "~95% accurate even with jargon or accents."
