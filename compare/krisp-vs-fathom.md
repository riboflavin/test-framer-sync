# Krisp vs. Fathom: Which should you choose?
AI meeting notes platforms provide four primary deliverables:

• Transcripts create a word-for-word record of the meeting. For example, a one-hour product development meeting generates a searchable document containing every feature discussion, technical requirement, and team decision.
• Action items are pulled directly from the conversation. When someone says "John will update the wireframes by Friday," the AI automatically creates a tracked task with the assignee and deadline.
• Meeting summaries distill hour-long conversations into 2-3 paragraphs. A 45-minute sprint planning meeting becomes a concise overview of sprint goals, resource allocation, and key decisions.
• Topic segmentation breaks discussions into labeled sections. A client call covering multiple projects is automatically divided into sections like "Website Redesign," "Q1 Marketing Campaign," and "Budget Review."

In addition to the quality of these deliverables, we'll want to look at a number of other key factors:

• Free trial: can you test it for free before committing?
• Ease-of-use: does it have a simple, intuitive setup that works for non-technical users?
• In-person meeting support: can it transcribe audio from live recordings or uploaded files, not just virtual calls?
• Security and privacy: how is customer data handled on the platform?
• Integrations: can it connect with your existing stack, like HubSpot, Notion, or Slack?
• Functionality: does it go beyond transcriptions and actually help you take action?
• Languages: can it transcribe and summarize meetings in different languages?
• Desktop and mobile apps: can you access it on Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android for on-the-go meeitngs?
• Recordings: is there support for saving and playing back audio and video recordings of meetings?
## Evaluating Krisp and Fathom
Krisp offers excellent noise cancellation for both microphone and speaker audio, platform-agnostic use, unlimited transcription, and a generous free plan. However, it has limitations on the free plan, concise summaries, lacks real-time collaboration, and can tax system resources during long meetings.

Fathom provides top-notch accuracy in transcripts, quick summaries, free unlimited core features, and support for multiple languages. However, it historically supported only Zoom, has some duplicate note issues, lacks live collaboration, and requires a paid plan for advanced features.

.
- Summaries are concise but not as in-depth as some competitors’ (geared toward quick recap).

.
- Lacks a bit in live collaboration; mainly focused on post-meeting output (notes are viewable after, not edited in real-time by multiple people).
- Advanced features like custom integrations or extended analytics require paid plan (free covers basics)..

Krisp may appeal to individuals or small businesses looking for a straightforward tool with a free plan, but its lack of integrations and limited support for in-person meetings may hinder its usefulness. Fathom, on the other hand, could be preferred by users seeking seamless Zoom and calendar integration, as well as compatibility with popular platforms like HubSpot and Notion. However, both tools fall short in terms of depth of integrations and may not fully support users in maximizing productivity during meetings.

Overall, Krisp's simplicity and free plan may attract casual users, while Fathom's ease of use and broad language support could benefit those seeking a more integrated meeting experience. Nevertheless, the limitations in integrations and practical meeting assistance may leave users wanting more from both tools.
