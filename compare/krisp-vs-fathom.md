# Krisp vs. Fathom – Which should you choose?  
AI meeting notes platforms provide four primary deliverables:  
  
* Transcripts create a word-for-word record of the meeting. For example, a one-hour product development meeting generates a searchable document containing every feature discussion, technical requirement, and team decision.  
* Action items are pulled directly from the conversation. When someone says "John will update the wireframes by Friday," the AI automatically creates a tracked task with the assignee and deadline.  
* Meeting summaries distill hour-long conversations into 2-3 paragraphs. A 45-minute sprint planning meeting becomes a concise overview of sprint goals, resource allocation, and key decisions.  
* Topic segmentation breaks discussions into labeled sections. A client call covering multiple projects is automatically divided into sections like "Website Redesign," "Q1 Marketing Campaign," and "Budget Review."  
  
In addition to the quality of these deliverables, we'll want to look at a number of other key factors:  
  
* Free trial: can you test it for free before committing?  
* Ease-of-use: does it have a simple, intuitive setup that works for non-technical users?  
* In-person meeting support: can it transcribe audio from live recordings or uploaded files, not just virtual calls?  
* Security and privacy: how is customer data handled on the platform?  
* Integrations: can it connect with your existing stack, like HubSpot, Notion, or Slack?  
* Functionality: does it go beyond transcriptions and actually help you take action?  
* Languages: can it transcribe and summarize meetings in different languages?  
* Desktop and mobile apps: can you access it on Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android for on-the-go meetings?  
* Recordings: is there support for saving and playing back audio and video recordings of meetings?    
## Evaluating Krisp and Fathom  
### Krisp
* Krisp provides noise cancellation for all audio sources and meeting platforms, with unlimited transcription and custom vocabulary support for specialized terms. The platform works independently for each user, with no team features, and includes basic functionality in its free tier with daily usage caps.
* System performance can be impacted during extended meetings due to AI processing requirements, and summaries focus on brevity rather than detail. Free users are limited to 60 minutes of noise removal and 2 summaries per day.

### Fathom
* Fathom offers transcription across multiple languages with support for multiple speakers, providing unlimited usage of core features in the free tier and detailed meeting summaries. The platform was initially Zoom-exclusive, with beta support for other platforms recently added.
* Team usage can result in duplicate notes when multiple members join the same call, and real-time collaboration features are limited, with notes only available for viewing after meetings. Advanced features and analytics require a paid subscription.  
## Comparison table    
Krisp makes sense for people who record a lot of in-person meetings or need a desktop app, and who don't care much about calendar syncing or CRM integration. The tool works well for basic recording and transcription needs, though it lacks the deeper workflow integrations that would make it truly powerful.

Fathom is better suited for remote teams who live in Zoom and need their meeting notes to flow into tools like Notion or HubSpot. While it offers good integration with common work tools, it still doesn't provide the kind of automation that would make meeting follow-up truly seamless.
