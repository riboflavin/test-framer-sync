# tldv vs Bluedot – Feature and product comparison

AI meeting notes platforms provide four primary deliverables:
* Transcripts that create a word-for-word record of the meeting. For example, a one-hour product development meeting generates a searchable document containing every feature discussion, technical requirement, and team decision.
* Action items are pulled directly from the conversation. When someone says "John will update the wireframes by Friday," the AI automatically creates a tracked task with the assignee and deadline.
* Meeting summaries distill hour-long conversations into 2-3 paragraphs. A 45-minute sprint planning meeting becomes a concise overview of sprint goals, resource allocation, and key decisions.
* Topic segmentation breaks discussions into labeled sections. A client call covering multiple projects is automatically divided into sections like "Website Redesign," "Q1 Marketing Campaign," and "Budget Review."

In addition to the quality of these deliverables, we'll want to look at a number of other key factors:
* Ease-of-use: does it have a simple, intuitive setup that works for non-technical users?
* In-person meeting support: can it transcribe audio from live recordings or uploaded files, not just virtual calls?
* Security and privacy: how is customer data handled on the platform?
* Integrations: can it connect with your existing stack, like HubSpot, Notion, or Slack?
* Functionality: does it go beyond transcriptions and actually help you take action?
* Languages: can it transcribe and summarize meetings in different languages?
* Desktop and mobile apps: can you access it on Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android for on-the-go meetings?

## About tldv
tldv is a meeting tool that records, transcribes, and summarizes conversations across platforms like Zoom and Microsoft Teams. It timestamps important moments, creates highlights, and integrates with CRM systems. Through its AI agents, it automates the recording process, note-taking, and data entry into other business systems. The software works with over 30 languages and offers local recording capabilities via desktop applications for Windows and macOS.

The service operates on a tiered pricing model with a free version and paid options at $18/month (Pro) and $59/month (Business). It requires internet connectivity to function properly and doesn't support in-person meetings. While it offers integrations with thousands of services including HubSpot, Notion, and Salesforce, it lacks native mobile applications. The desktop app handles the core functionality of capturing and processing meeting content.

## About Bluedot
Bluedot is an AI meeting recorder and note-taker that operates as a Chrome extension without requiring a meeting bot. It records and transcribes meetings on Google Meet, Zoom, and Microsoft Teams in real-time, generating AI-powered notes that can be synced to CRMs, project tools, and document platforms with one click. The tool supports over 100 languages for transcription and works across all major meeting platforms, making it particularly useful for people who need accurate transcripts and workflow integration.

The pricing structure starts with a limited free version (5 meetings total), then moves to paid tiers: Basic ($18/month) for unlimited audio recordings up to 1 hour each, Pro ($25/month) for unlimited video recording and custom templates, and Business ($40/month) which adds CRM integrations and unlimited guest members. Bluedot works for in-person meetings, records locally, and offers extensive integrations, though it lacks mobile apps and focuses primarily on desktop/web experiences.

## Comparison
### tldv

* tldv offers AI meeting recording, transcription and summarization with a focus on CRM integration and automated note-taking. It provides accurate transcriptions and an intuitive interface but suffers from limited platform support and reliance on internet connectivity.
* The tool supplies basic integrations with HubSpot, Notion, and Salesforce, but lacks the depth needed to truly enhance productivity from meetings. While it offers a generous free plan alongside paid tiers, its functionality remains somewhat surface-level for teams seeking comprehensive meeting workflow automation.

### Bluedot

* Bluedot provides meeting recording via Chrome extension without requiring bot presence, supporting transcription in over 100 languages. Its free version is extremely limited with only 5 lifetime meetings, while the best experience is restricted to Chrome desktop users.
* The platform offers integration with various tools like Slack, Notion and CRMs, but these connections don't fully address the fundamental challenges of extracting actionable value from meetings. Despite its accuracy in transcription, the limited free tier and relatively steep pricing at higher tiers present barriers to adoption.

| Feature | tldv | Bluedot |
|---------|------|---------|
| Free Plan | Generous tier | Limited (5 meetings) |
| Price Range | $0-59/mo | $0-40/mo |
| Language Support | 30+ languages ✅ | 100+ languages ✅ |
| In-person Recording | Not available ❌ | Available ✅ |
| Local Recording | Desktop app ✅ | Chrome extension ✅ |
| Integration Depth | Basic ❌ | Basic ❌ |
| Mobile Support | No app ❌ | No app ❌ |
| Desktop App | Windows/macOS ✅ | Windows/macOS ✅ |
| Bot Requirement | Required ❌ | Not required ✅ |

For teams prioritizing a generous free tier and simple meeting recording, tldv offers better value with its unlimited free recordings. Its straightforward functionality works well for organizations with occasional meeting recording needs who don't require extensive post-meeting workflow automation. Teams comfortable with having a bot present in meetings will find tldv's approach familiar and accessible.

Bluedot better serves professionals who need discreet recording without bot presence, especially in client-facing or external meetings. Its superior language support and in-person recording capabilities make it more versatile for global teams or field work. However, serious users must commit to paid plans almost immediately, making it more appropriate for sales teams, researchers, and other roles where meeting intelligence directly impacts revenue outcomes.
