# Fathom vs Krisp for meeting automation

Fathom is an AI meeting assistant that works with Zoom, Google Meet, and Teams. It records meetings, transcribes in real-time across 25+ languages, and generates different types of summaries including bullet lists, action items, and chronological summaries. The system identifies speakers, allows manual highlighting during calls, and offers post-meeting features including an overview, action items, follow-up email drafts, and an AI Q&A function. It's primarily used by sales representatives and people who want to focus on conversations rather than taking notes.

Fathom offers a free plan with unlimited recordings but AI summaries limited to 5 meetings monthly. Paid tiers range from $15/month for individuals to $29/user/month for advanced team features. It works only with scheduled online meetings and cannot process external audio files. The desktop app is required, and there's no mobile app. Integrations include CRM systems like HubSpot and Salesforce, plus connections to Slack and Notion. The system supports transcription in approximately 25 languages.

Krisp is an audio enhancement tool with meeting assistant capabilities. It functions as a real-time noise cancellation system that removes background sounds and echo across communication apps by acting as an audio filter layer. Additionally, it offers meeting recording, transcription in 90+ languages, and AI-generated summaries with key points and action items extracted from conversations.

The software works with virtually any voice application and can capture both online and in-person conversations through its desktop app for Windows and Mac. Krisp offers a free tier with 60 minutes of daily noise cancellation and limited meeting summaries, while paid plans (starting at $8/month) provide unlimited usage of all features. The tool includes calendar integration and HubSpot CRM connectivity to sync meeting data.

## Comparing Fathom and Krisp

### Fathom
* Fathom offers AI meeting transcription for online platforms with comprehensive summaries, action items, and searchable recordings. Its integration is limited to major video conferencing platforms, and while it excels at capturing content, it lacks deeper workflow automation to help users implement meeting outcomes.

### Krisp
* Krisp combines noise cancellation with meeting transcription and AI summaries, working across virtually any communication app. Despite its audio enhancement capabilities, Krisp's integration ecosystem remains basic, offering limited pathways to turn meeting insights into actionable workflows within users' broader tech stack.

Fathom fits best for teams primarily using Zoom, Google Meet, or Teams who need reliable meeting transcription and organized summaries. Sales teams benefit from its CRM integrations, while its straightforward interface works well for those who need clean meeting records but aren't looking for audio enhancement capabilities.

Krisp serves users in noisy environments or those requiring flexibility across many communication platforms. Its noise cancellation makes it ideal for call center workers, those in shared workspaces, or remote workers with background distractions, while still providing meeting intelligence as a secondary benefit across a wider range of scenarios than Fathom.

## Fathom vs Krisp: What do users say?

Fathom is a popular AI meeting assistant primarily for Zoom, Google Meet, and Teams that automatically records, transcribes, and generates various AI summaries of meetings. Users particularly highlight its generous free plan, accurate transcriptions, and intuitive interface. The tool provides different summary formats (bullet lists, action items, chronological summaries) and allows users to highlight important points during calls. Reviewers consistently mention how Fathom enables them to be fully present in meetings while trusting the tool to capture everything. Some limitations include certain advanced features being restricted to paid plans, lack of external audio file upload capability, and the absence of a mobile app.

Krisp offers a dual function as both a noise cancellation tool and meeting assistant. Its primary feature removes background noise and echo from microphone or speaker output across virtually all communication apps. Recently, Krisp added meeting transcription and AI summary capabilities. Users consistently praise how effectively it eliminates unwanted sounds, making calls more professional. The AI note-taking feature generates structured summaries with key points and action items that users find "extremely accurate." Downsides include occasional audio distortion when canceling very loud noises, limited free plan usage (60 minutes daily), potential high CPU usage, and some concerns about pricing for the full feature set.

## FAQs 
• Would Fathom work for in-person meetings? What about Krisp?
No, Fathom cannot work for in-person meetings as it "Cannot import external audio – only works for scheduled online meetings (Zoom, Google Meet, Teams)." Krisp, on the other hand, can work for in-person meetings as it "Captures any conversation (online or offline) using noise-canceling audio on your device."

• What about meeting bots? Does either of these tools require a meeting bot?
Based on the context, Krisp specifically "Records & transcribes meetings locally via the Krisp app (no bot; works with any voice app)." The information doesn't explicitly state whether Fathom requires a meeting bot, though it mentions it works through a desktop app that auto-records meetings on supported platforms.

• What do users say about the quality of transcriptions?
For Fathom, users praise the transcriptions as "quick and accurate." For Krisp, the reviews are more mixed - while some users found the AI note-taking and summaries "extremely accurate," others note that Krisp "might distort the speaker's voice or clip words, especially if trying to cancel very loud noises – this can affect transcription accuracy."
