# Fathom vs Krisp for meeting automation

Here's what you should look for in an AI meeting automation tool:  
* Transcripts that create a word-for-word record of the meeting. For example, a one-hour product development meeting generates a searchable document containing every feature discussion, technical requirement, and team decision.
* [Action items](/releases/add-action-items-to-meetings) are pulled directly from the conversation. When someone says "John will update the wireframes by Friday," the AI automatically creates a tracked task with the assignee and deadline.
* Meeting summaries distill hour-long conversations into 2-3 paragraphs. A 45-minute sprint planning meeting becomes a concise overview of sprint goals, resource allocation, and key decisions.
* Topic segmentation breaks discussions into labeled sections. A client call covering multiple projects is automatically divided into sections like "Website Redesign," "Q1 Marketing Campaign," and "Budget Review."

## Other key features
In addition to the quality of these deliverables, we'll want to look at a number of other key factors:
* Ease-of-use: does it have a simple, intuitive setup that works for non-technical users?
* In-person meeting support: can it transcribe audio from live recordings or uploaded files, not just virtual calls?
* Security and privacy: how is customer data handled on the platform?
* Integrations: can it connect with your existing stack, like HubSpot, Notion, or Slack?
* Functionality: does it go beyond transcriptions and actually help you take action?
* Languages: can it transcribe and summarize meetings in different languages?
* Desktop and mobile apps: can you access it on Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android for on-the-go meetings?

## Understanding Fathom and Krisp
Fathom is an AI meeting assistant that works with Zoom, Google Meet, and Teams. It records meetings, transcribes in real-time across 25+ languages, and generates different types of summaries including bullet lists, action items, and chronological summaries. The system identifies speakers, allows manual highlighting during calls, and offers post-meeting features including an overview, action items, follow-up email drafts, and an AI Q&A function. It's primarily used by sales representatives and people who want to focus on conversations rather than taking notes.

Fathom offers a free plan with unlimited recordings but AI summaries limited to 5 meetings monthly. Paid tiers range from $15/month for individuals to $29/user/month for advanced team features. It works only with scheduled online meetings and cannot process external audio files. The desktop app is required, and there's no mobile app. Integrations include CRM systems like HubSpot and Salesforce, plus connections to Slack and Notion. The system supports transcription in approximately 25 languages.

Krisp is an audio enhancement tool with meeting assistant capabilities. It functions as a real-time noise cancellation system that removes background sounds and echo across communication apps by acting as an audio filter layer. Additionally, it offers meeting recording, transcription in 90+ languages, and AI-generated summaries with key points and action items extracted from conversations.

The software works with virtually any voice application and can capture both online and in-person conversations through its desktop app for Windows and Mac. Krisp offers a free tier with 60 minutes of daily noise cancellation and limited meeting summaries, while paid plans (starting at $8/month) provide unlimited usage of all features. The tool includes calendar integration and HubSpot CRM connectivity to sync meeting data.

## Comparing Fathom and Krisp

### Fathom
* Fathom offers AI meeting transcription for online platforms with comprehensive summaries, action items, and searchable recordings. Its integration is limited to major video conferencing platforms, and while it excels at capturing content, it lacks deeper workflow automation to help users implement meeting outcomes.

### Krisp
* Krisp combines noise cancellation with meeting transcription and AI summaries, working across virtually any communication app. Despite its audio enhancement capabilities, Krisp's integration ecosystem remains basic, offering limited pathways to turn meeting insights into actionable workflows within users' broader tech stack.

| Feature | Fathom | Krisp |
|---------|--------|-------|
| In-person meetings | ❌ Not supported | ✅ Fully supported |
| Local recording | ⚠️ Limited support | ✅ Full support |
| Integrations | ⚠️ Basic CRMs | ⚠️ Calendar, CRM |
| Automation | ⚠️ Basic summaries | ⚠️ Limited workflows |
| Language support | ✅ 25+ languages | ✅ 90+ languages |
| Desktop app | ✅ Mac/Windows | ✅ Mac/Windows |
| Mobile app | ❌ Not available | ❌ Not available |
| Core strength | Online meetings | Noise cancellation |

Fathom fits best for teams primarily using Zoom, Google Meet, or Teams who need reliable meeting transcription and organized summaries. Sales teams benefit from its CRM integrations, while its straightforward interface works well for those who need clean meeting records but aren't looking for audio enhancement capabilities.

Krisp serves users in noisy environments or those requiring flexibility across many communication platforms. Its noise cancellation makes it ideal for call center workers, those in shared workspaces, or remote workers with background distractions, while still providing meeting intelligence as a secondary benefit across a wider range of scenarios than Fathom.
