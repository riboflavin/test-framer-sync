# Fathom vs. Krisp: Which should you choose?
AI meeting notes platforms provide four primary deliverables:

• Transcripts create a word-for-word record of the meeting. For example, a one-hour product development meeting generates a searchable document containing every feature discussion, technical requirement, and team decision.
• Action items are pulled directly from the conversation. When someone says "John will update the wireframes by Friday," the AI automatically creates a tracked task with the assignee and deadline.
• Meeting summaries distill hour-long conversations into 2-3 paragraphs. A 45-minute sprint planning meeting becomes a concise overview of sprint goals, resource allocation, and key decisions.
• Topic segmentation breaks discussions into labeled sections. A client call covering multiple projects is automatically divided into sections like "Website Redesign," "Q1 Marketing Campaign," and "Budget Review."

In addition to the quality of these deliverables, we'll want to look at a number of other key factors:

• Free trial: can you test it for free before committing?
• Ease-of-use: does it have a simple, intuitive setup that works for non-technical users?
• In-person meeting support: can it transcribe audio from live recordings or uploaded files, not just virtual calls?
• Security and privacy: how is customer data handled on the platform?
• Integrations: can it connect with your existing stack, like HubSpot, Notion, or Slack?
• Functionality: does it go beyond transcriptions and actually help you take action?
• Languages: can it transcribe and summarize meetings in different languages?
• Desktop and mobile apps: can you access it on Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android for on-the-go meeitngs?
• Recordings: is there support for saving and playing back audio and video recordings of meetings?
## Evaluating Fathom and Krisp
Fathom offers top-notch accuracy in transcripts and quick, high-quality summaries, with free unlimited usage for core features and support for many languages. However, it historically only supported Zoom, has some duplicate note issues, and lacks live collaboration features.

Krisp provides excellent noise cancellation, platform-agnostic use, unlimited transcription, and a generous free plan. However, its free plan has limits, summaries are not as in-depth, and it lacks real-time collaboration and multi-user features, potentially taxing system resources during long meetings.

.
- Summaries are concise but not as in-depth as some competitors’ (geared toward quick recap).

Fathom might appeal to individuals or companies looking for a free and easy-to-use tool with Zoom and calendar integration, as well as support for multiple languages. However, it falls short in not being suitable for in-person meetings, lacking local recording capabilities, and limited integrations with platforms like HubSpot and Notion.

Krisp could be preferred by those seeking a free plan, ease of use, and compatibility with desktop and mobile devices. Nevertheless, it lacks depth in integrations with popular tools and services, as well as an automation engine to streamline meeting processes effectively.
