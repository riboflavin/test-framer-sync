# Fathom vs. Krisp – Which should you choose?  
AI meeting notes platforms provide four primary deliverables:  
  
* Transcripts create a word-for-word record of the meeting. For example, a one-hour product development meeting generates a searchable document containing every feature discussion, technical requirement, and team decision.  
* Action items are pulled directly from the conversation. When someone says "John will update the wireframes by Friday," the AI automatically creates a tracked task with the assignee and deadline.  
* Meeting summaries distill hour-long conversations into 2-3 paragraphs. A 45-minute sprint planning meeting becomes a concise overview of sprint goals, resource allocation, and key decisions.  
* Topic segmentation breaks discussions into labeled sections. A client call covering multiple projects is automatically divided into sections like "Website Redesign," "Q1 Marketing Campaign," and "Budget Review."  
  
In addition to the quality of these deliverables, we'll want to look at a number of other key factors:  
  
* Free trial: can you test it for free before committing?  
* Ease-of-use: does it have a simple, intuitive setup that works for non-technical users?  
* In-person meeting support: can it transcribe audio from live recordings or uploaded files, not just virtual calls?  
* Security and privacy: how is customer data handled on the platform?  
* Integrations: can it connect with your existing stack, like HubSpot, Notion, or Slack?  
* Functionality: does it go beyond transcriptions and actually help you take action?  
* Languages: can it transcribe and summarize meetings in different languages?  
* Desktop and mobile apps: can you access it on Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android for on-the-go meetings?  
* Recordings: is there support for saving and playing back audio and video recordings of meetings?    
## Evaluating Fathom and Krisp  
### Fathom
* Fathom offers accurate transcription with multi-speaker support and quick meeting summaries, with free unlimited core features and strong multi-language capabilities. The platform started as Zoom-only with beta support for other platforms, and has some limitations around duplicate notes and real-time collaboration.

### Krisp
* Krisp provides noise cancellation for audio input/output and works with any meeting platform, offering unlimited transcription and custom vocabulary training. The free tier has usage limits of 60 minutes daily for noise removal and 2 summaries per day, while the tool functions individually rather than collaboratively and can be resource-intensive.  
## Comparison table    
Fathom works best for remote teams and sales organizations who need their meeting notes synced to tools like HubSpot and Notion, though the lack of automation means you'll still be doing most of the work manually. The web-based approach makes it easy to get started, but you'll need to be online and in a video call for it to be useful.

Krisp is built for people who record a lot of in-person meetings or need local recording capabilities, and its desktop app makes it more reliable for these scenarios. While it handles multiple languages well, its limited integrations mean you'll be copying and pasting content between apps, and like Fathom, it won't actually help automate your meeting workflow.
