# Fathom vs. Krisp – Which should you choose?  
AI meeting notes platforms provide four primary deliverables:  
  
* Transcripts create a word-for-word record of the meeting. For example, a one-hour product development meeting generates a searchable document containing every feature discussion, technical requirement, and team decision.  
* Action items are pulled directly from the conversation. When someone says "John will update the wireframes by Friday," the AI automatically creates a tracked task with the assignee and deadline.  
* Meeting summaries distill hour-long conversations into 2-3 paragraphs. A 45-minute sprint planning meeting becomes a concise overview of sprint goals, resource allocation, and key decisions.  
* Topic segmentation breaks discussions into labeled sections. A client call covering multiple projects is automatically divided into sections like "Website Redesign," "Q1 Marketing Campaign," and "Budget Review."  
  
In addition to the quality of these deliverables, we'll want to look at a number of other key factors:  
  
* Free trial: can you test it for free before committing?  
* Ease-of-use: does it have a simple, intuitive setup that works for non-technical users?  
* In-person meeting support: can it transcribe audio from live recordings or uploaded files, not just virtual calls?  
* Security and privacy: how is customer data handled on the platform?  
* Integrations: can it connect with your existing stack, like HubSpot, Notion, or Slack?  
* Functionality: does it go beyond transcriptions and actually help you take action?  
* Languages: can it transcribe and summarize meetings in different languages?  
* Desktop and mobile apps: can you access it on Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android for on-the-go meetings?  
* Recordings: is there support for saving and playing back audio and video recordings of meetings?    
## Evaluating Fathom and Krisp  
### Fathom
* Fathom offers free transcription and AI summaries that appear seconds after meetings, with different summary formats and structured note sections in paid plans. The service works only for live meetings, lacks a mobile app, and requires desktop use, with some users finding the on-screen elements distracting.

### Krisp
* Krisp removes background noise during calls and provides AI note-taking with summaries and action items. The service has a 60-minute daily limit on the free plan, can sometimes distort audio or clip words with loud noises, uses significant CPU resources, and receives mixed reviews for customer support response times.  
## Comparison table    
Fathom works best for remote teams who need basic automation and want their meeting content synced to other tools, though the integration options are still quite limited. The lack of local recording and in-person capabilities makes it less suitable for hybrid teams who need to capture conversations happening in conference rooms.

Krisp is better suited for companies with hybrid work environments who need reliable local recording and in-person meeting capture, but don't require much automation. While it offers some basic integrations, it doesn't help teams do much with their meeting content beyond basic transcription and recording.
