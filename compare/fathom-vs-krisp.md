# Fathom vs. Krisp: Which should you choose?  
AI meeting notes platforms provide four primary deliverables:  
  
* Transcripts create a word-for-word record of the meeting. For example, a one-hour product development meeting generates a searchable document containing every feature discussion, technical requirement, and team decision.  
* Action items are pulled directly from the conversation. When someone says "John will update the wireframes by Friday," the AI automatically creates a tracked task with the assignee and deadline.  
* Meeting summaries distill hour-long conversations into 2-3 paragraphs. A 45-minute sprint planning meeting becomes a concise overview of sprint goals, resource allocation, and key decisions.  
* Topic segmentation breaks discussions into labeled sections. A client call covering multiple projects is automatically divided into sections like "Website Redesign," "Q1 Marketing Campaign," and "Budget Review."  
  
In addition to the quality of these deliverables, we'll want to look at a number of other key factors:  
  
* Free trial: can you test it for free before committing?  
* Ease-of-use: does it have a simple, intuitive setup that works for non-technical users?  
* In-person meeting support: can it transcribe audio from live recordings or uploaded files, not just virtual calls?  
* Security and privacy: how is customer data handled on the platform?  
* Integrations: can it connect with your existing stack, like HubSpot, Notion, or Slack?  
* Functionality: does it go beyond transcriptions and actually help you take action?  
* Languages: can it transcribe and summarize meetings in different languages?  
* Desktop and mobile apps: can you access it on Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android for on-the-go meetings?  
* Recordings: is there support for saving and playing back audio and video recordings of meetings?    
## Evaluating Fathom and Krisp  
### Fathom
- Top-notch accuracy in transcripts, even with multiple speakers
- Quick, high-quality summaries that capture key points and decisions
- Free unlimited usage for core features
- Supports many languages (users report better results for non-English than competitors)
- Historically Zoom-only (new support for other platforms is recent and in beta)
- Some duplicate note issues if multiple team members use it simultaneously on a call
- Lacks a bit in live collaboration; mainly focused on post-meeting output (notes are viewable after, not edited in real-time by multiple people)
- Advanced features like custom integrations or extended analytics require paid plan (free covers basics)

### Krisp
- Excellent noise cancellation for both microphone and speaker audio
- Platform-agnostic – use with any meeting software, even phone calls
- Unlimited transcription on all plans (no minute caps)
- Generous free plan (includes noise reduction and a couple summaries/day)
- Custom vocabulary improves accuracy for industry terms
- Free plan limits: 60 min/day noise removal, 2 summaries/day
- Summaries are concise but not as in-depth as some competitors’ (geared toward quick recap)
- No real-time collab or multi-user features – it’s a personal tool (teams would each use their own instance)
- Can tax system resources during long meetings (CPU usage for AI processing)

| Good for In-Person Meetings?      | ❌ No                | ✅ Yes               |
| Good for Local Recording?         | ❌ No                | ✅ Yes               |
| Integrates with HubSpot, Notion, etc.? | ✅ Yes           | ❌ No                |
| Automation Engine?                | ❌ No                | ❌ No                |
| Language Support                  | ✅ Multiple languages| ✅ Multiple languages|
| Desktop App                       | ❌ No (Web-based)    | ✅ Yes (Mac & Windows)|
| iPhone & Android Apps             | ✅ Yes (Both)        | ✅ Yes (Both)        |  
- Fathom may appeal to individuals or businesses seeking a free tool with Zoom and calendar integration, as well as support for multiple languages. However, it lacks depth in integrations with popular platforms like HubSpot and Notion, limiting its usefulness in streamlining meeting workflows.

- Krisp, on the other hand, could be preferred by those looking for a free and easy-to-use solution with local recording capabilities. While it offers desktop and mobile apps for convenience, its lack of integrations with key business tools and absence of an automation engine may hinder its ability to truly enhance meeting productivity.
