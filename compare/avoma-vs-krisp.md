# Avoma vs. Krisp – Which should you choose?  
AI meeting notes platforms provide four primary deliverables:  
  
* Transcripts create a word-for-word record of the meeting. For example, a one-hour product development meeting generates a searchable document containing every feature discussion, technical requirement, and team decision.  
* Action items are pulled directly from the conversation. When someone says "John will update the wireframes by Friday," the AI automatically creates a tracked task with the assignee and deadline.  
* Meeting summaries distill hour-long conversations into 2-3 paragraphs. A 45-minute sprint planning meeting becomes a concise overview of sprint goals, resource allocation, and key decisions.  
* Topic segmentation breaks discussions into labeled sections. A client call covering multiple projects is automatically divided into sections like "Website Redesign," "Q1 Marketing Campaign," and "Budget Review."  
  
In addition to the quality of these deliverables, we'll want to look at a number of other key factors:  
  
* Free trial: can you test it for free before committing?  
* Ease-of-use: does it have a simple, intuitive setup that works for non-technical users?  
* In-person meeting support: can it transcribe audio from live recordings or uploaded files, not just virtual calls?  
* Security and privacy: how is customer data handled on the platform?  
* Integrations: can it connect with your existing stack, like HubSpot, Notion, or Slack?  
* Functionality: does it go beyond transcriptions and actually help you take action?  
* Languages: can it transcribe and summarize meetings in different languages?  
* Desktop and mobile apps: can you access it on Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android for on-the-go meetings?  
* Recordings: is there support for saving and playing back audio and video recordings of meetings?    
## Evaluating Avoma and Krisp  
### Avoma
* Avoma provides transcription with 95% accuracy including jargon and accents, integrates with common business tools, and includes meeting note automation. The platform offers a free tier but includes many features beyond basic transcription, which can be complex for simple use cases. Some users report occasional bugs with meeting joins and speaker identification, and higher tier pricing is expensive for small teams.

### Krisp
* Krisp focuses on noise cancellation during calls and includes AI note-taking with action item extraction. The free plan limits noise cancellation to 60 minutes daily, some users report audio distortion with loud background noise, and the application can be CPU-intensive. Customer support response times vary, and pricing can be high for users who only need single features.  
## Comparison table    
Avoma makes sense for sales teams and customer success managers who need to record lots of calls and get basic automation working, though they'll likely need other tools to make their workflow complete. The mobile apps help field sales teams stay productive, while the automation can save some manual work after calls end.

Krisp works better for individual professionals and small teams who just need clean audio and basic recording features for their daily meetings, especially since it runs right on the desktop. The lack of mobile apps and automation means it's not ideal for larger teams or complex use cases, but it handles the basics well enough for most people.
