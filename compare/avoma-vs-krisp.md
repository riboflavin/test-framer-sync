# Avoma vs Krisp for meeting automation

Avoma is an AI meeting assistant platform that records, transcribes, and summarizes meetings. It generates notes organized by topics like pain points and next steps, with approximately 95% transcription accuracy even with accents or jargon. The system offers agenda templates, live note collaboration, CRM integration with Salesforce and HubSpot, and supports over 20 languages. It functions across both online and offline meetings through mobile recording.

The platform operates on a tiered pricing model starting with a free plan (limited to about 10 meetings monthly), then paid tiers from $19 to $129 per user monthly. It integrates with various tools including Zoom, calendars, and CRMs, while automating note-taking and follow-up tasks. Some users find it overly complex for basic transcription needs, occasionally experience delays with the bot joining meetings, and note that transcripts can be dense to review quickly. The system has web and mobile apps but no dedicated desktop application.

Krisp is an AI voice enhancement tool that functions as both a noise cancellation system and meeting assistant. It removes background noises like dog barks, keyboard sounds, and echo from audio in real-time across communication apps by acting as an audio filter layer. The tool has expanded to include meeting recording, transcription in 90+ languages, and AI-generated summaries with key points and action items.

The software operates through a desktop app for Windows and Mac, with no current mobile app support. It offers a free tier with 60 minutes of daily noise cancellation and limited meeting summaries, while paid plans start at $8/month for unlimited features. Krisp integrates with calendar systems for one-click recording and HubSpot CRM to transfer meeting content. The tool works for both online and offline conversations, recording locally without requiring a meeting bot.

## Comparing Avoma and Krisp

### Avoma

- Avoma functions as an all-in-one meeting assistant that records, transcribes, and summarizes conversations through structured topic breakdowns. While it offers comprehensive features including CRM integration and agenda templates, its limited integration depth makes it challenging to fully incorporate into existing workflows.

### Krisp

- Krisp started as a noise cancellation tool but expanded to offer meeting transcription and AI summaries with key points extraction. Despite its technical strengths in audio enhancement, the platform lacks robust integrations and streamlined automation capabilities that would enable users to take meaningful action based on meeting insights.

Avoma suits sales teams and enterprises requiring detailed meeting documentation and basic CRM integration. Its strength in categorizing conversation topics and supporting collaborative note-taking makes it valuable for teams needing to capture and organize complex discussions, though its premium pricing and platform complexity may overwhelm individual users or small teams with simple needs.

Krisp works best for remote workers in noisy environments who need clear audio and basic meeting capture. Its core noise cancellation technology combined with meeting transcription offers a unique solution for professionals in call centers or shared workspaces, but its limited automation capabilities and integration options make it less suitable for teams requiring seamless workflows across multiple applications.

## Avoma vs Krisp: What do users say?

Avoma user reviews highlight it as an all-in-one AI meeting assistant that excels at recording, transcribing, and summarizing meetings with approximately 95% accuracy, even with jargon or accents. Users particularly appreciate how it saves time on administrative tasks and allows them to focus on conversations instead of note-taking. The platform generates organized notes broken into topics and actionable insights, with strong integration capabilities across Zoom, HubSpot, Slack, and other tools. While support is responsive, some users find it to be more than a basic transcriber and potentially overkill for individual users. Minor bugs, occasional delays in joining meetings, and dense transcripts that can be difficult to skim quickly are noted downsides. Pricing ranges from a free limited plan to premium tiers that some small teams may find expensive.

Krisp users consistently praise its exceptional noise cancellation abilities, noting that it "just works" to eliminate unwanted background sounds like dog barks, keyboard clicks, and other voices. The platform has evolved beyond noise removal to include meeting transcription and AI summaries that generate structured notes with key points and tasks. Users find these summaries "extremely accurate" with minimal editing needed. However, some report audio quirks where voices might occasionally be distorted or words clipped, especially when canceling very loud noises. Other concerns include the free plan's limited 60 minutes per day of noise cancellation, relatively high CPU usage, and pricing that some find steep if they only need one feature. Customer support receives mixed reviews with some mentioning slow response times.
