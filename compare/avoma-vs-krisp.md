# Avoma vs. Krisp: Which should you choose?
AI meeting notes platforms provide four primary deliverables:

• Transcripts create a word-for-word record of the meeting. For example, a one-hour product development meeting generates a searchable document containing every feature discussion, technical requirement, and team decision.
• Action items are pulled directly from the conversation. When someone says "John will update the wireframes by Friday," the AI automatically creates a tracked task with the assignee and deadline.
• Meeting summaries distill hour-long conversations into 2-3 paragraphs. A 45-minute sprint planning meeting becomes a concise overview of sprint goals, resource allocation, and key decisions.
• Topic segmentation breaks discussions into labeled sections. A client call covering multiple projects is automatically divided into sections like "Website Redesign," "Q1 Marketing Campaign," and "Budget Review."

In addition to the quality of these deliverables, we'll want to look at a number of other key factors:

• Free trial: can you test it for free before committing?
• Ease-of-use: does it have a simple, intuitive setup that works for non-technical users?
• In-person meeting support: can it transcribe audio from live recordings or uploaded files, not just virtual calls?
• Security and privacy: how is customer data handled on the platform?
• Integrations: can it connect with your existing stack, like HubSpot, Notion, or Slack?
• Functionality: does it go beyond transcriptions and actually help you take action?
• Languages: can it transcribe and summarize meetings in different languages?
• Desktop and mobile apps: can you access it on Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android for on-the-go meeitngs?
• Recordings: is there support for saving and playing back audio and video recordings of meetings?
## Evaluating Avoma and Krisp
Avoma offers highly accurate transcriptions and AI summaries, with clear speaker separation and workflow integrations, but lacks a free tier and can be complex for new users. The platform requires a paid plan from the start and may have issues with the meeting bot joining late or missing speaker names.

Krisp provides excellent noise cancellation, platform-agnostic usage, unlimited transcription, and a generous free plan, but has limitations on the free plan, concise summaries, and lacks real-time collaboration features. Users may experience system resource strain during long meetings due to CPU usage for AI processing.
In general, users say that Avoma: - Highly accurate transcriptions, ensures no detail is lost​g2.com
.
- Excellent AI summaries and highlights make review easy​g2.com
.
- Speaker separation and labeling is very clear in notes​g2.com
.
- Workflow integrations (CRM sync, calendar, etc.) streamline follow-ups.. However, they also say: - No free tier (only a trial); requires paid plan from the start.
- Expensive for full features (advanced plans ~$59–79 user/mo)​avoma.com
.
- Complex for new users – many features mean a learning curve (setup & onboarding effort).
- Meeting bot sometimes joins a bit late or misses a speaker name​g2.com
..
In general, users say that Krisp: - Excellent noise cancellation for both microphone and speaker audio​ddiy.co
.
- Platform-agnostic – use with any meeting software, even phone calls​ddiy.co
.
- Unlimited transcription on all plans (no minute caps)​ddiy.co
.
- Generous free plan (includes noise reduction and a couple summaries/day)​ddiy.co
.
- Custom vocabulary improves accuracy for industry terms​ddiy.co
.. However, they also say: - Free plan limits: 60 min/day noise removal, 2 summaries/day​ddiy.co
.
- Summaries are concise but not as in-depth as some competitors’ (geared toward quick recap).
- No real-time collab or multi-user features – it’s a personal tool (teams would each use their own instance).
- Can tax system resources during long meetings (CPU usage for AI processing)..
| Feature                           | Avoma       | Krisp       |
|-----------------------------------|-------------|-------------|
| Trial/Free Plan                   | ❌ Trial only | ✅ Free plan |
| Zoom & Calendar Integration        | ✅ Yes       | ❌ No        |
| Easy to Use?                       | ❌ Learning curve | ✅ Yes |
| Good for In-Person Meetings?       | ❌ No        | ✅ Yes       |
| Good for Local Recording?          | ❌ No        | ✅ Yes       |
| Integrates with HubSpot, Notion, etc.? | ❌ No    | ❌ No        |
| Automation Engine?                 | ✅ Yes       | ❌ No        |
| Language Support                   | ❌ English only | ✅ Multiple languages |
| Desktop App                       | ❌ No (Web-based) | ✅ Yes (Mac & Windows) |
| iPhone & Android Apps             | ✅ Yes (Both) | ✅ Yes (Both) |
Avoma might appeal to companies looking for a tool with a trial option and Zoom integration, but may fall short for those seeking deeper integrations with other platforms like HubSpot and Notion. While it offers an automation engine, its lack of support for in-person meetings and local recording could limit its usefulness in practical scenarios.

Krisp, on the other hand, could be attractive to individuals or businesses in need of a free plan, easy-to-use interface, and support for multiple languages. However, its absence of integrations with popular tools like HubSpot and Notion, as well as the limited depth of its features for enhancing meeting productivity, may leave users wanting more in terms of functionality and efficiency.
