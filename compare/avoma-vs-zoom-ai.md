# Avoma vs. Zoom AI: Which should you choose?
AI meeting notes platforms provide four primary deliverables:

• Transcripts create a word-for-word record of the meeting. For example, a one-hour product development meeting generates a searchable document containing every feature discussion, technical requirement, and team decision.
• Action items are pulled directly from the conversation. When someone says "John will update the wireframes by Friday," the AI automatically creates a tracked task with the assignee and deadline.
• Meeting summaries distill hour-long conversations into 2-3 paragraphs. A 45-minute sprint planning meeting becomes a concise overview of sprint goals, resource allocation, and key decisions.
• Topic segmentation breaks discussions into labeled sections. A client call covering multiple projects is automatically divided into sections like "Website Redesign," "Q1 Marketing Campaign," and "Budget Review."

In addition to the quality of these deliverables, we'll want to look at a number of other key factors:

• Free trial: can you test it for free before committing?
• Ease-of-use: does it have a simple, intuitive setup that works for non-technical users?
• In-person meeting support: can it transcribe audio from live recordings or uploaded files, not just virtual calls?
• Security and privacy: how is customer data handled on the platform?
• Integrations: can it connect with your existing stack, like HubSpot, Notion, or Slack?
• Functionality: does it go beyond transcriptions and actually help you take action?
• Languages: can it transcribe and summarize meetings in different languages?
• Desktop and mobile apps: can you access it on Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android for on-the-go meeitngs?
• Recordings: is there support for saving and playing back audio and video recordings of meetings?
## Evaluating Avoma and Zoom AI
Avoma offers highly accurate transcriptions and AI summaries, with clear speaker separation and workflow integrations. However, it lacks a free tier, is expensive for full features, and can be complex for new users.

Zoom AI provides native integration with Zoom, real-time Q&A, and a unique whiteboard AI feature. Yet, it is limited to Zoom usage, requires a paid Zoom plan, has speaker ID restrictions, and lacks custom vocabulary support.

Avoma might appeal to companies looking for a tool with integrations to popular platforms like HubSpot and Notion, as well as an automation engine. However, its lack of support for in-person meetings and local recording could limit its usefulness for those seeking a comprehensive solution for meeting management.

Zoom AI, with its native integration with Zoom and ease of use, could be attractive to individuals or businesses looking for a straightforward solution for meeting assistance. Nevertheless, its limited integrations with other tools and absence of an automation engine may hinder its ability to fully support users in achieving their meeting objectives.
