# Avoma vs. Zoom AI – Which should you choose?  
AI meeting notes platforms provide four primary deliverables:  
  
* Transcripts create a word-for-word record of the meeting. For example, a one-hour product development meeting generates a searchable document containing every feature discussion, technical requirement, and team decision.  
* Action items are pulled directly from the conversation. When someone says "John will update the wireframes by Friday," the AI automatically creates a tracked task with the assignee and deadline.  
* Meeting summaries distill hour-long conversations into 2-3 paragraphs. A 45-minute sprint planning meeting becomes a concise overview of sprint goals, resource allocation, and key decisions.  
* Topic segmentation breaks discussions into labeled sections. A client call covering multiple projects is automatically divided into sections like "Website Redesign," "Q1 Marketing Campaign," and "Budget Review."  
  
In addition to the quality of these deliverables, we'll want to look at a number of other key factors:  
  
* Free trial: can you test it for free before committing?  
* Ease-of-use: does it have a simple, intuitive setup that works for non-technical users?  
* In-person meeting support: can it transcribe audio from live recordings or uploaded files, not just virtual calls?  
* Security and privacy: how is customer data handled on the platform?  
* Integrations: can it connect with your existing stack, like HubSpot, Notion, or Slack?  
* Functionality: does it go beyond transcriptions and actually help you take action?  
* Languages: can it transcribe and summarize meetings in different languages?  
* Desktop and mobile apps: can you access it on Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android for on-the-go meetings?  
* Recordings: is there support for saving and playing back audio and video recordings of meetings?    
## Evaluating Avoma and Zoom AI  
### Avoma
* Avoma provides accurate transcription with clear speaker labels and CRM integrations for workflow automation, while offering AI-generated summaries and highlights for efficient meeting review. The platform requires paid plans starting around $59-79 per user monthly, has no free tier, and presents a learning curve for new users due to feature complexity.

### Zoom AI
* Zoom AI integrates natively with Zoom meetings, offering real-time AI assistance, whiteboard features, and meeting summaries directly in Zoom Chat, with no additional cost for Zoom subscribers. The tool only works within Zoom platforms, requires a paid Zoom subscription, cannot identify speakers who aren't logged in, and lacks custom vocabulary for specialized terminology.  
## Comparison table    
Avoma makes sense for sales teams and companies who need their meeting tools to work with HubSpot and other business apps, though its learning curve and limited integrations mean you'll still be doing a lot manually. The automation features help with basic tasks, but you'll need to be comfortable with a web-based interface and willing to pay from day one.

Zoom AI is the obvious choice for teams already using Zoom who want the simplest possible meeting solution without switching platforms, though its lack of third-party integrations means it won't help much with your actual workflow. The native desktop apps make it convenient, but like Avoma, it's really just scratching the surface of what's possible with meeting productivity.
