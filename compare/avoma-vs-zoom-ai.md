# Avoma vs. Zoom AI – Which should you choose?  
AI meeting notes platforms provide four primary deliverables:  
  
* Transcripts create a word-for-word record of the meeting. For example, a one-hour product development meeting generates a searchable document containing every feature discussion, technical requirement, and team decision.  
* Action items are pulled directly from the conversation. When someone says "John will update the wireframes by Friday," the AI automatically creates a tracked task with the assignee and deadline.  
* Meeting summaries distill hour-long conversations into 2-3 paragraphs. A 45-minute sprint planning meeting becomes a concise overview of sprint goals, resource allocation, and key decisions.  
* Topic segmentation breaks discussions into labeled sections. A client call covering multiple projects is automatically divided into sections like "Website Redesign," "Q1 Marketing Campaign," and "Budget Review."  
  
In addition to the quality of these deliverables, we'll want to look at a number of other key factors:  
  
* Free trial: can you test it for free before committing?  
* Ease-of-use: does it have a simple, intuitive setup that works for non-technical users?  
* In-person meeting support: can it transcribe audio from live recordings or uploaded files, not just virtual calls?  
* Security and privacy: how is customer data handled on the platform?  
* Integrations: can it connect with your existing stack, like HubSpot, Notion, or Slack?  
* Functionality: does it go beyond transcriptions and actually help you take action?  
* Languages: can it transcribe and summarize meetings in different languages?  
* Desktop and mobile apps: can you access it on Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android for on-the-go meetings?  
* Recordings: is there support for saving and playing back audio and video recordings of meetings?    
## Evaluating Avoma and Zoom AI  
### Avoma
* Avoma delivers 95% accurate transcription with strong platform integrations and comprehensive meeting tools, while offering a free tier for basic use and responsive customer support. The platform includes extensive administrative automation and workflow features that reduce manual note-taking needs.
* The platform can be complex for simple transcription needs and occasionally experiences technical delays or speaker identification issues, while higher tier pricing may be costly for small teams and transcript formats can be difficult to quickly review.

### Zoom AI
* Zoom AI integrates directly into existing Zoom installations with automatic meeting tracking and instant post-meeting summaries, requiring minimal setup and included with paid Zoom accounts. The system operates entirely within Zoom's ecosystem and focuses on core meeting documentation features.
* The tool only functions within Zoom meetings, has limited features compared to dedicated meeting tools, and shows basic integration with Zoom Chat, while some users report difficulties accessing AI notes outside the Zoom environment.  
## Comparison table    
Small teams and startups that need flexibility across different meeting types would likely choose Avoma, since it works for both virtual and in-person meetings and offers a free trial to test it out. The basic integrations and automation features could help these teams do a bit more with their meetings, though they'll still need other tools to fully streamline their workflow.

Larger companies already using Zoom might naturally gravitate toward Zoom AI, especially if they need a desktop app and don't mind paying upfront for the service. While Zoom AI handles virtual meetings well and offers good security, its limited automation and integration capabilities mean teams will need additional solutions to properly manage their meeting workflows.
