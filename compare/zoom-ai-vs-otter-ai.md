# Zoom AI vs. Otter.ai: Which should you choose?
AI meeting notes platforms provide four primary deliverables:

• Transcripts create a word-for-word record of the meeting. For example, a one-hour product development meeting generates a searchable document containing every feature discussion, technical requirement, and team decision.
• Action items are pulled directly from the conversation. When someone says "John will update the wireframes by Friday," the AI automatically creates a tracked task with the assignee and deadline.
• Meeting summaries distill hour-long conversations into 2-3 paragraphs. A 45-minute sprint planning meeting becomes a concise overview of sprint goals, resource allocation, and key decisions.
• Topic segmentation breaks discussions into labeled sections. A client call covering multiple projects is automatically divided into sections like "Website Redesign," "Q1 Marketing Campaign," and "Budget Review."

In addition to the quality of these deliverables, we'll want to look at a number of other key factors:

• Free trial: can you test it for free before committing?
• Ease-of-use: does it have a simple, intuitive setup that works for non-technical users?
• In-person meeting support: can it transcribe audio from live recordings or uploaded files, not just virtual calls?
• Security and privacy: how is customer data handled on the platform?
• Integrations: can it connect with your existing stack, like HubSpot, Notion, or Slack?
• Functionality: does it go beyond transcriptions and actually help you take action?
• Languages: can it transcribe and summarize meetings in different languages?
• Desktop and mobile apps: can you access it on Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android for on-the-go meeitngs?
• Recordings: is there support for saving and playing back audio and video recordings of meetings?

Zoom AI might be preferred by individuals or companies heavily reliant on Zoom for their meetings, as it offers native integration with Zoom and a user-friendly interface. However, both tools lack deep integrations with popular platforms like HubSpot and Notion, limiting their usefulness in streamlining workflows. Additionally, neither tool is particularly effective for in-person meetings or local recording, which may deter users looking for comprehensive meeting solutions.

On the other hand, Otter.ai could be suitable for users seeking a free plan with calendar integration and easy-to-use features. Despite its strengths, Otter.ai also falls short in terms of integrations and practical meeting functionalities. The lack of an automation engine and limited language support further restrict its capabilities in assisting users with meeting-related tasks.
