# Zoom AI vs. Otter.ai – Which should you choose?  
AI meeting notes platforms provide four primary deliverables:  
  
* Transcripts create a word-for-word record of the meeting. For example, a one-hour product development meeting generates a searchable document containing every feature discussion, technical requirement, and team decision.  
* Action items are pulled directly from the conversation. When someone says "John will update the wireframes by Friday," the AI automatically creates a tracked task with the assignee and deadline.  
* Meeting summaries distill hour-long conversations into 2-3 paragraphs. A 45-minute sprint planning meeting becomes a concise overview of sprint goals, resource allocation, and key decisions.  
* Topic segmentation breaks discussions into labeled sections. A client call covering multiple projects is automatically divided into sections like "Website Redesign," "Q1 Marketing Campaign," and "Budget Review."  
  
In addition to the quality of these deliverables, we'll want to look at a number of other key factors:  
  
* Free trial: can you test it for free before committing?  
* Ease-of-use: does it have a simple, intuitive setup that works for non-technical users?  
* In-person meeting support: can it transcribe audio from live recordings or uploaded files, not just virtual calls?  
* Security and privacy: how is customer data handled on the platform?  
* Integrations: can it connect with your existing stack, like HubSpot, Notion, or Slack?  
* Functionality: does it go beyond transcriptions and actually help you take action?  
* Languages: can it transcribe and summarize meetings in different languages?  
* Desktop and mobile apps: can you access it on Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android for on-the-go meetings?  
* Recordings: is there support for saving and playing back audio and video recordings of meetings?    
## Evaluating Zoom AI and Otter.ai  
### Zoom AI
* Zoom AI integrates directly into Zoom meetings with real-time Q&A, whiteboard AI for diagrams, and outputs in Zoom Chat, requiring no additional setup for paid Zoom subscribers. The service is limited to Zoom-only meetings, requires a paid Zoom plan, has speaker identification limitations for non-logged-in users, and lacks custom vocabulary for industry terms.

### Otter.ai
* Otter.ai offers an intuitive interface with live transcript editing, includes a free plan with generous limits, and integrates with Zoom and calendars for automatic recording. The service struggles with accent recognition and fast speech, only supports English language, and sometimes requires manual fixes for speaker identification.  
## Comparison table    
Zoom AI makes sense for companies already invested in Zoom's ecosystem who want the simplest possible meeting assistant without adding another vendor. The native integration and desktop apps are convenient for teams who just need basic meeting support and don't mind paying for it through their Zoom subscription.

Otter.ai works better for individual users or small teams who want a free option and don't need desktop software. While both tools handle the basics of meeting transcription and summaries well enough, neither offers the deep integrations or automation capabilities that would make them truly indispensable for getting real work done.
