# Zoom AI vs. Otter.ai: Which should you choose?
AI meeting notes platforms provide four primary deliverables:  
  
* Transcripts create a word-for-word record of the meeting. For example, a one-hour product development meeting generates a searchable document containing every feature discussion, technical requirement, and team decision.  
* Action items are pulled directly from the conversation. When someone says "John will update the wireframes by Friday," the AI automatically creates a tracked task with the assignee and deadline.  
* Meeting summaries distill hour-long conversations into 2-3 paragraphs. A 45-minute sprint planning meeting becomes a concise overview of sprint goals, resource allocation, and key decisions.  
* Topic segmentation breaks discussions into labeled sections. A client call covering multiple projects is automatically divided into sections like "Website Redesign," "Q1 Marketing Campaign," and "Budget Review."  
  
In addition to the quality of these deliverables, we'll want to look at a number of other key factors:  
  
* Free trial: can you test it for free before committing?  
* Ease-of-use: does it have a simple, intuitive setup that works for non-technical users?  
* In-person meeting support: can it transcribe audio from live recordings or uploaded files, not just virtual calls?  
* Security and privacy: how is customer data handled on the platform?  
* Integrations: can it connect with your existing stack, like HubSpot, Notion, or Slack?
• Functionality: does it go beyond transcriptions and actually help you take action?
• Languages: can it transcribe and summarize meetings in different languages?
• Desktop and mobile apps: can you access it on Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android for on-the-go meeitngs?
• Recordings: is there support for saving and playing back audio and video recordings of meetings?

- Companies or individuals looking for a free option may prefer Otter.ai due to its availability of a free plan, while those already using Zoom may opt for Zoom AI for its native integration with Zoom and calendar. However, both tools lack depth in integrations with other platforms like HubSpot and Notion, limiting their usefulness for users seeking a more comprehensive solution.

- Neither Zoom AI nor Otter.ai are ideal for in-person meetings or local recording, and both fall short in providing an automation engine to help users streamline their meeting processes. Additionally, the language support is limited to English only for both tools, and while Zoom AI offers mobile apps for iPhone and Android, Otter.ai is solely web-based, potentially limiting its accessibility for users on the go.
