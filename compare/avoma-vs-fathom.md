# Avoma vs. Fathom – Which should you choose?  
AI meeting notes platforms provide four primary deliverables:  
  
* Transcripts create a word-for-word record of the meeting. For example, a one-hour product development meeting generates a searchable document containing every feature discussion, technical requirement, and team decision.  
* Action items are pulled directly from the conversation. When someone says "John will update the wireframes by Friday," the AI automatically creates a tracked task with the assignee and deadline.  
* Meeting summaries distill hour-long conversations into 2-3 paragraphs. A 45-minute sprint planning meeting becomes a concise overview of sprint goals, resource allocation, and key decisions.  
* Topic segmentation breaks discussions into labeled sections. A client call covering multiple projects is automatically divided into sections like "Website Redesign," "Q1 Marketing Campaign," and "Budget Review."  
  
In addition to the quality of these deliverables, we'll want to look at a number of other key factors:  
  
* Free trial: can you test it for free before committing?  
* Ease-of-use: does it have a simple, intuitive setup that works for non-technical users?  
* In-person meeting support: can it transcribe audio from live recordings or uploaded files, not just virtual calls?  
* Security and privacy: how is customer data handled on the platform?  
* Integrations: can it connect with your existing stack, like HubSpot, Notion, or Slack?  
* Functionality: does it go beyond transcriptions and actually help you take action?  
* Languages: can it transcribe and summarize meetings in different languages?  
* Desktop and mobile apps: can you access it on Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android for on-the-go meetings?  
* Recordings: is there support for saving and playing back audio and video recordings of meetings?    
## Evaluating Avoma and Fathom  
### Avoma
* Avoma delivers 95% accurate transcription with strong integrations for Zoom, HubSpot, and Slack, plus offers a free tier and responsive support. The platform includes comprehensive meeting tools and administrative automation, though some find it more complex than needed for basic transcription.
* The system occasionally has technical issues like delayed meeting joins and speaker identification errors, and higher pricing tiers can be expensive for small teams. The detailed transcripts can be dense to parse, and the full feature set may be excessive for individual users.

### Fathom
* Fathom provides quick transcription with AI summaries, featuring a generous free tier and straightforward interface for live meetings. The platform focuses on core meeting capture functionality and delivers summaries in multiple formats.
* The platform lacks external audio file support and a mobile app, with some advanced features restricted to paid tiers. Users note the on-screen elements can be distracting during calls, though these can be hidden.  
## Comparison table    
Avoma makes sense for sales teams and companies that need to record both virtual and in-person meetings, with its mobile app making it practical for field sales and consulting work. The platform offers standard integrations with CRM tools and note-taking apps, though users often need to create manual workflows to make the most of their meeting content.

Fathom appeals to remote workers and desk-based professionals who want a dedicated desktop app for their virtual meetings, particularly those using Zoom or Teams extensively. While it handles the basics of meeting capture and offers common integrations, users still need to do much of the heavy lifting when it comes to actually implementing insights from their conversations.
