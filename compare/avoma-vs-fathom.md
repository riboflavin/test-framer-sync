# Avoma vs. Fathom – Which should you choose?  
AI meeting notes platforms provide four primary deliverables:  
  
* Transcripts create a word-for-word record of the meeting. For example, a one-hour product development meeting generates a searchable document containing every feature discussion, technical requirement, and team decision.  
* Action items are pulled directly from the conversation. When someone says "John will update the wireframes by Friday," the AI automatically creates a tracked task with the assignee and deadline.  
* Meeting summaries distill hour-long conversations into 2-3 paragraphs. A 45-minute sprint planning meeting becomes a concise overview of sprint goals, resource allocation, and key decisions.  
* Topic segmentation breaks discussions into labeled sections. A client call covering multiple projects is automatically divided into sections like "Website Redesign," "Q1 Marketing Campaign," and "Budget Review."  
  
In addition to the quality of these deliverables, we'll want to look at a number of other key factors:  
  
* Free trial: can you test it for free before committing?  
* Ease-of-use: does it have a simple, intuitive setup that works for non-technical users?  
* In-person meeting support: can it transcribe audio from live recordings or uploaded files, not just virtual calls?  
* Security and privacy: how is customer data handled on the platform?  
* Integrations: can it connect with your existing stack, like HubSpot, Notion, or Slack?  
* Functionality: does it go beyond transcriptions and actually help you take action?  
* Languages: can it transcribe and summarize meetings in different languages?  
* Desktop and mobile apps: can you access it on Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android for on-the-go meetings?  
* Recordings: is there support for saving and playing back audio and video recordings of meetings?    
## Evaluating Avoma and Fathom  
### Avoma
* Avoma provides accurate transcription with clear speaker labels, AI-generated summaries and highlights, and extensive workflow integrations including CRM and calendar sync. The platform requires a paid subscription starting around $59-79 per user monthly, has no free tier beyond trials, and presents a learning curve for new users due to feature complexity.

### Fathom
* Fathom delivers accurate transcription including strong multi-speaker and multi-language support, with AI summaries and unlimited free usage of core features. The platform has historically been Zoom-focused with other integrations in beta, can have duplicate note issues with multiple simultaneous users, and requires paid plans for advanced features like custom integrations and analytics.  
## Comparison table    
Avoma makes sense for sales teams and companies that need automation and don't mind spending time learning a more complex tool. The automation features could save time for teams that have standardized their meeting workflows, though they'll need to work around the limited language support and web-only interface.

Fathom works better for individual users and small teams who want something simple that just works, especially if they need multiple language support. While the free plan and ease of use are appealing, the lack of automation and limited integration depth means users still need other tools to handle their full meeting workflow.
