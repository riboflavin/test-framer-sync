# Granola vs Zoom AI for meeting automation

Granola is a Mac-based AI notepad for meetings that captures system audio without requiring a meeting bot. Users jot minimal notes during calls, and upon meeting completion, Granola generates structured notes with key takeaways and next steps. It works with all meeting platforms by capturing system audio, offers customizable templates for different meeting types, and includes an AI assistant for answering questions or generating follow-up content.

The tool runs completely on the user's device, records and transcribes locally, and supports about 16 languages. After a free trial of 25 meetings, pricing starts at $18/month for individuals, with business ($14/user/month) and enterprise ($35/user/month) plans available. Current limitations include Mac-only support (Windows version pending), no mobile apps yet, and limited integrations beyond calendar sync and Notion export.

Zoom AI is an integrated feature within the Zoom platform that automatically generates meeting summaries and action items after calls. It enables participants to ask questions during meetings to catch up on missed information, assists with composing emails and documents related to meetings, and requires no additional setup for existing Zoom users. The functionality works exclusively within Zoom's ecosystem and is included at no additional cost for paid Zoom subscribers.

The tool only functions for virtual Zoom meetings and cannot capture in-person conversations independently. While Zoom allows local meeting recording, the AI summaries require Zoom's cloud service. The feature offers limited integrations outside the Zoom ecosystem, provides automated summaries and Q&A but lacks external workflow automation capabilities, and supports over 30 languages through Zoom's transcription service. It's accessible through Zoom desktop clients on Windows/Mac and mobile apps on iOS/Android for paid plan subscribers.

## Comparing Granola and Zoom AI

### Granola

* Granola functions as a desktop app that captures meeting audio across platforms without requiring a bot, producing structured notes based on audio and user keywords. The tool falls short on integration depth, offering limited connections to other productivity tools that could enhance workflow automation.

* Pricing starts with a free trial of 25 meetings, then $18/month for individuals or $14/user/month for teams, with Mac-only support currently limiting its accessibility. While Granola excels at passive note-taking, it lacks robust mechanisms to help users actually implement meeting outcomes or automate follow-up tasks.

### Zoom AI

* Zoom AI provides built-in meeting summaries and action items exclusively for Zoom's platform, allowing participants to ask questions during meetings and assisting with related communications. The platform's limited integration ecosystem restricts its utility, keeping content siloed within Zoom rather than connecting to the broader tools where work actually happens.

* Included at no additional cost for paid Zoom subscribers but unavailable on free plans, Zoom AI offers limited meeting management capabilities compared to dedicated tools. Despite its convenience for Zoom users, the tool struggles with helping users translate meeting content into actionable workflows across their broader tech stack.

Granola appears best suited for users who participate in meetings across multiple platforms and need a standalone tool that works regardless of meeting software. The product's strength lies in its platform-agnostic approach and offline functionality, making it valuable for consultants, freelancers, and teams using varied communication channels.

Zoom AI naturally fits organizations heavily invested in Zoom's ecosystem who want a zero-setup solution included with their existing subscription. Its in-platform experience benefits teams already standardized on Zoom who need basic AI assistance without learning a new tool, though users requiring cross-platform support or deeper integrations will find its capabilities limited.

## Granola vs Zoom AI: What do users say?

Granola AI serves as an AI notepad for meetings, running on Mac computers and capturing system audio without requiring a bot in the call. Users can jot brief notes during meetings, and Granola produces enhanced, structured summaries afterward with key takeaways and next steps. Reviews highlight its "set and forget" functionality that allows users to focus on conversations while still getting quality notes. The clean, simple interface reminds users of Apple Notes, and the customizable templates deliver well-organized summaries formatted to user preferences. Limitations include its Mac-only availability (as of 2024), lack of a mobile app, and reliance on device audio capture. Pricing begins with 25 free meetings, followed by plans starting at $18/month for individuals.

Zoom AI functions as a built-in feature for Zoom's platform, automatically generating meeting summaries and action items after calls. It allows participants to ask questions during meetings and assists with composing emails and documents. Users appreciate its seamless integration within the Zoom ecosystem, eliminating the need for separate apps. The AI generates summaries almost instantly after meetings, and it's included at no extra cost for paid Zoom accounts. However, it only works with Zoom meetings, not other platforms, and some users find certain features immature compared to dedicated note-taking tools. The service is included free with Zoom Pro plans (starting around $15/month per user).

## FAQs 
• Would Granola work for in-person meetings? What about Zoom AI?
Granola works partially for in-person meetings - the Mac app can capture in-room audio locally. Zoom AI does not work for in-person meetings as it only functions for virtual Zoom calls and cannot independently capture in-person audio.

• What about meeting bots? Does either of these tools require a meeting bot?
Granola does not require a meeting bot - it "listens to meetings without needing a bot in the call" and "works fully offline on Mac" for recording and transcribing locally. Zoom AI also doesn't require a separate bot as it's built into the Zoom platform itself.
