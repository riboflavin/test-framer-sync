# Granola vs. Krisp – Which should you choose?  
AI meeting notes platforms provide four primary deliverables:  
  
* Transcripts create a word-for-word record of the meeting. For example, a one-hour product development meeting generates a searchable document containing every feature discussion, technical requirement, and team decision.  
* Action items are pulled directly from the conversation. When someone says "John will update the wireframes by Friday," the AI automatically creates a tracked task with the assignee and deadline.  
* Meeting summaries distill hour-long conversations into 2-3 paragraphs. A 45-minute sprint planning meeting becomes a concise overview of sprint goals, resource allocation, and key decisions.  
* Topic segmentation breaks discussions into labeled sections. A client call covering multiple projects is automatically divided into sections like "Website Redesign," "Q1 Marketing Campaign," and "Budget Review."  
  
In addition to the quality of these deliverables, we'll want to look at a number of other key factors:  
  
* Free trial: can you test it for free before committing?  
* Ease-of-use: does it have a simple, intuitive setup that works for non-technical users?  
* In-person meeting support: can it transcribe audio from live recordings or uploaded files, not just virtual calls?  
* Security and privacy: how is customer data handled on the platform?  
* Integrations: can it connect with your existing stack, like HubSpot, Notion, or Slack?  
* Functionality: does it go beyond transcriptions and actually help you take action?  
* Languages: can it transcribe and summarize meetings in different languages?  
* Desktop and mobile apps: can you access it on Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android for on-the-go meetings?  
* Recordings: is there support for saving and playing back audio and video recordings of meetings?    
## Evaluating Granola and Krisp  
### Granola
* Granola functions as a device-level note-taking tool that transcribes any audio without needing meeting bots, works with custom templates, and provides accurate transcription to supplement manual notes. The app is currently MacOS-only, has limited integrations, lacks multi-user features, and offers basic transcript editing capabilities as a new product still in development.

### Krisp
* Krisp provides noise cancellation for both input and output audio across all meeting platforms including phone calls, with unlimited transcription on all plans and custom vocabulary support for specialized terminology. The free tier caps noise removal at 60 minutes daily with 2 summaries per day, lacks real-time collaboration features, produces basic summaries, and can be resource-intensive during extended meetings.  
## Comparison table    
Granola seems best suited for Mac-focused small teams and freelancers who primarily work in English and don't need mobile access. The Mac-only desktop app and limited language support suggest it's built for users who want a simple, straightforward solution without complex integrations or automation needs.

Krisp appears designed for larger, distributed teams who need cross-platform support and multiple language options. While it offers broader device compatibility and language flexibility, it still lacks meaningful integrations with common workplace tools and doesn't provide automation capabilities that could make meetings more productive.
