# Granola vs Krisp for meeting automation

Granola is a note-taking application for Mac that captures meeting audio without requiring a bot in the call. It allows users to jot brief notes during meetings across platforms like Zoom, Teams, and Webex, then produces structured summaries with key takeaways and next steps when the meeting ends. Users can customize note templates for different meeting types and use an AI assistant to generate follow-up content like email summaries.

The app records and transcribes locally on Mac, capturing system audio across all meeting platforms. After a 25-meeting free trial, pricing starts at $18/month for individuals or $14/user/month for business teams. Current limitations include Mac-only support (no Windows version), no mobile app, and limited integrations, with Notion export and HubSpot integration in beta stages.

Krisp is an AI voice enhancement tool that functions as both a noise cancellation system and meeting assistant. It removes background noise and echo from audio in real-time across communication platforms, while also offering meeting recording, transcription, and AI-generated summaries with key points and action items. The application works by acting as an audio filter between your microphone/speakers and communication apps, requiring no meeting bots.

The software operates on Windows and Mac through a desktop application, supporting 90+ languages for transcription. Krisp offers a free tier with 60 minutes daily of noise cancellation and limited meeting summaries, while paid plans start at $8/month for unlimited features. It includes calendar integration and HubSpot connectivity, but has no mobile app support currently. Some users report occasional audio distortion issues and relatively high CPU usage during operation.

## Comparing Granola and Krisp

### Granola
- Granola offers automated meeting notes that combine audio capture with user input to produce structured summaries. It functions across meeting platforms and accommodates customizable templates, though its limited integrations restrict how these notes can be shared and utilized in workflows.

- The system operates locally on Mac, requiring no meeting intrusion, which allows users to focus on conversations rather than documentation. Despite its clean interface and quality summaries, Granola's Mac-only limitation and absence of robust integrations with productivity tools limits its effectiveness as a comprehensive meeting solution.

### Krisp
- Krisp combines noise cancellation technology with meeting transcription and AI summaries, capturing conversations across various platforms while cleaning audio in real-time. While offering more platform compatibility than Granola, its integration ecosystem falls short of seamlessly connecting meeting insights to the tools where work actually happens.

- The dual functionality provides both clearer audio and automatic documentation, saving time on note-taking and preventing embarrassing interruptions. However, occasional audio distortion issues, resource-intensive operation, and limited workflow automation capabilities prevent Krisp from fully addressing the end-to-end meeting productivity challenge.

| Feature | Granola | Krisp |
|---------|---------|-------|
| Platform Support | Mac only ❌ | Windows/Mac ✅ |
| In-person Meetings | Partial support ❌ | Full support ✅ |
| Local Recording | Offline capable ✅ | Offline capable ✅ |
| Integrations | Limited options ❌ | Basic options ❌ |

| Language Support | 16 languages ❌ | 95+ languages ✅ |
| Mobile App | None available ❌ | None available ❌ |

Granola suits Mac users who prioritize simplicity and want frictionless, unobtrusive meeting documentation. Its local processing and template customization make it appropriate for those handling sensitive information or who prefer a consistent note structure across meetings, though Mac-only support limits its audience.

Krisp better serves users working in noisy environments who need both audio enhancement and documentation. Its cross-platform support makes it more accessible for mixed-device teams, and its extensive language capabilities benefit global organizations. The free tier also provides an entry point for occasional users, though both tools ultimately require workflow adjustments to compensate for their integration limitations.

## Granola vs Krisp: What do users say?

Users praise Granola as a discreet "set and forget" AI note-taking tool for meetings that captures system audio without requiring a bot in the call. They appreciate its clean Apple Notes-like interface and well-organized, customizable summaries. The main limitations include its Mac-only availability (Windows support frequently requested), lack of mobile apps, and reliance on system audio capture. Pricing starts with 25 free meetings, followed by plans from $18/month for individuals.

Krisp receives consistent praise for its excellent noise cancellation that "just works" to eliminate background sounds during calls. Users appreciate how it integrates with all communication apps as an audio filter. The newer AI meeting transcription and summary features are well-received for their accuracy. Some drawbacks include occasional audio distortion when canceling loud noises, the free plan's 60-minute daily limit, and reports of high CPU usage. Pricing ranges from a limited free tier to Pro ($8/month) and Business ($15/user/month) plans.

## FAQs 
• Would Granola work for in-person meetings? What about Krisp?
Granola can partially work for in-person meetings as the Mac app can capture in-room audio locally. Krisp is better suited for in-person meetings as it "captures any conversation (online or offline) using noise-canceling audio on your device."

• What about meeting bots? Does either of these tools require a meeting bot?
Neither tool requires a meeting bot. Granola "listens to meetings without needing a bot in the call" and "works fully offline on Mac – records and transcribes locally (no internet or bot needed)." Similarly, Krisp "records & transcribes meetings locally via the Krisp app (no bot; works with any voice app)."

• What do users say about the quality of transcriptions?
For Krisp, users report that the summaries with key points and action items were "extremely accurate," requiring minimal edits. However, some users note that Krisp might occasionally distort the speaker's voice or clip words, especially with very loud noises, which "can affect transcription accuracy."
