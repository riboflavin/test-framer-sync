# Granola vs Krisp – Feature and product comparison

AI meeting notes platforms provide four primary deliverables:
* Transcripts that create a word-for-word record of the meeting. For example, a one-hour product development meeting generates a searchable document containing every feature discussion, technical requirement, and team decision.
* Action items are pulled directly from the conversation. When someone says "John will update the wireframes by Friday," the AI automatically creates a tracked task with the assignee and deadline.
* Meeting summaries distill hour-long conversations into 2-3 paragraphs. A 45-minute sprint planning meeting becomes a concise overview of sprint goals, resource allocation, and key decisions.
* Topic segmentation breaks discussions into labeled sections. A client call covering multiple projects is automatically divided into sections like "Website Redesign," "Q1 Marketing Campaign," and "Budget Review."

In addition to the quality of these deliverables, we'll want to look at a number of other key factors:
* Ease-of-use: does it have a simple, intuitive setup that works for non-technical users?
* In-person meeting support: can it transcribe audio from live recordings or uploaded files, not just virtual calls?
* Security and privacy: how is customer data handled on the platform?
* Integrations: can it connect with your existing stack, like HubSpot, Notion, or Slack?
* Functionality: does it go beyond transcriptions and actually help you take action?
* Languages: can it transcribe and summarize meetings in different languages?
* Desktop and mobile apps: can you access it on Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android for on-the-go meetings?

## About Granola
Granola is a note-taking application for Mac that captures meeting audio without requiring a bot in the call. It allows users to jot brief notes during meetings across platforms like Zoom, Teams, and Webex, then produces structured summaries with key takeaways and next steps when the meeting ends. Users can customize note templates for different meeting types and use an AI assistant to generate follow-up content like email summaries.

The app records and transcribes locally on Mac, capturing system audio across all meeting platforms. After a 25-meeting free trial, pricing starts at $18/month for individuals or $14/user/month for business teams. Current limitations include Mac-only support (no Windows version), no mobile app, and limited integrations, with Notion export and HubSpot integration in beta stages.

## About Krisp
Krisp is an AI voice enhancement tool that functions as both a noise cancellation system and meeting assistant. It removes background noise and echo from audio in real-time across communication platforms, while also offering meeting recording, transcription, and AI-generated summaries with key points and action items. The application works by acting as an audio filter between your microphone/speakers and communication apps, requiring no meeting bots.

The software operates on Windows and Mac through a desktop application, supporting 90+ languages for transcription. Krisp offers a free tier with 60 minutes daily of noise cancellation and limited meeting summaries, while paid plans start at $8/month for unlimited features. It includes calendar integration and HubSpot connectivity, but has no mobile app support currently. Some users report occasional audio distortion issues and relatively high CPU usage during operation.

## Comparison
### Granola
- Granola offers automated meeting notes that combine audio capture with user input to produce structured summaries. It functions across meeting platforms and accommodates customizable templates, though its limited integrations restrict how these notes can be shared and utilized in workflows.

- The system operates locally on Mac, requiring no meeting intrusion, which allows users to focus on conversations rather than documentation. Despite its clean interface and quality summaries, Granola's Mac-only limitation and absence of robust integrations with productivity tools limits its effectiveness as a comprehensive meeting solution.

### Krisp
- Krisp combines noise cancellation technology with meeting transcription and AI summaries, capturing conversations across various platforms while cleaning audio in real-time. While offering more platform compatibility than Granola, its integration ecosystem falls short of seamlessly connecting meeting insights to the tools where work actually happens.

- The dual functionality provides both clearer audio and automatic documentation, saving time on note-taking and preventing embarrassing interruptions. However, occasional audio distortion issues, resource-intensive operation, and limited workflow automation capabilities prevent Krisp from fully addressing the end-to-end meeting productivity challenge.

| Feature | Granola | Krisp |
|---------|---------|-------|
| Platform Support | Mac only ❌ | Windows/Mac ✅ |
| In-person Meetings | Partial support ❌ | Full support ✅ |
| Local Recording | Offline capable ✅ | Offline capable ✅ |
| Integrations | Limited options ❌ | Basic options ❌ |
| Automation | Note generation ❌ | Basic automation ❌ |
| Language Support | 16 languages ❌ | 95+ languages ✅ |
| Mobile App | None available ❌ | None available ❌ |
| Free Tier | 25 meetings ❌ | 60 min/day ✅ |

Granola suits Mac users who prioritize simplicity and want frictionless, unobtrusive meeting documentation. Its local processing and template customization make it appropriate for those handling sensitive information or who prefer a consistent note structure across meetings, though Mac-only support limits its audience.

Krisp better serves users working in noisy environments who need both audio enhancement and documentation. Its cross-platform support makes it more accessible for mixed-device teams, and its extensive language capabilities benefit global organizations. The free tier also provides an entry point for occasional users, though both tools ultimately require workflow adjustments to compensate for their integration limitations.
