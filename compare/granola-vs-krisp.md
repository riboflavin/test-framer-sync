# Granola vs. Krisp: Which should you choose?
AI meeting notes platforms provide four primary deliverables:

• Transcripts create a word-for-word record of the meeting. For example, a one-hour product development meeting generates a searchable document containing every feature discussion, technical requirement, and team decision.
• Action items are pulled directly from the conversation. When someone says "John will update the wireframes by Friday," the AI automatically creates a tracked task with the assignee and deadline.
• Meeting summaries distill hour-long conversations into 2-3 paragraphs. A 45-minute sprint planning meeting becomes a concise overview of sprint goals, resource allocation, and key decisions.
• Topic segmentation breaks discussions into labeled sections. A client call covering multiple projects is automatically divided into sections like "Website Redesign," "Q1 Marketing Campaign," and "Budget Review."

In addition to the quality of these deliverables, we'll want to look at a number of other key factors:

• Free trial: can you test it for free before committing?
• Ease-of-use: does it have a simple, intuitive setup that works for non-technical users?
• In-person meeting support: can it transcribe audio from live recordings or uploaded files, not just virtual calls?
• Security and privacy: how is customer data handled on the platform?
• Integrations: can it connect with your existing stack, like HubSpot, Notion, or Slack?
• Functionality: does it go beyond transcriptions and actually help you take action?
• Languages: can it transcribe and summarize meetings in different languages?
• Desktop and mobile apps: can you access it on Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android for on-the-go meeitngs?
• Recordings: is there support for saving and playing back audio and video recordings of meetings?
## Evaluating Granola and Krisp
Granola: Users appreciate its minimal, user-friendly interface and accurate transcription quality. However, it is limited to MacOS, lacks integrations, and does not support multi-user collaboration.

Krisp: Users value its excellent noise cancellation, platform-agnostic nature, and unlimited transcription. Yet, the free plan has usage limits, summaries may lack depth, and it lacks real-time collaboration features.
In general, users say that Granola: - Minimal, user-friendly app – feels like a regular notepad​ddiy.co
.
- No meeting bot needed, works on any platform by listening on device (more discreet).
- Custom templates for notes yield tailored summaries​ddiy.co
.
- Accurate transcription quality helps fill in details you miss​ddiy.co
.. However, they also say: - MacOS only (Windows version in waitlist; no mobile app yet)​deepgram.com
​businessinsider.com
.
- Few integrations currently; mostly a standalone tool​ddiy.co
.
- Lacks multi-user features – designed for individual note-taking (you manually share notes after).
- New product – still adding features, so some capabilities (editing transcripts, etc.) are basic..
In general, users say that Krisp: - Excellent noise cancellation for both microphone and speaker audio​ddiy.co
.
- Platform-agnostic – use with any meeting software, even phone calls​ddiy.co
.
- Unlimited transcription on all plans (no minute caps)​ddiy.co
.
- Generous free plan (includes noise reduction and a couple summaries/day)​ddiy.co
.
- Custom vocabulary improves accuracy for industry terms​ddiy.co
.. However, they also say: - Free plan limits: 60 min/day noise removal, 2 summaries/day​ddiy.co
.
- Summaries are concise but not as in-depth as some competitors’ (geared toward quick recap).
- No real-time collab or multi-user features – it’s a personal tool (teams would each use their own instance).
- Can tax system resources during long meetings (CPU usage for AI processing)..

| Zoom & Calendar Integration             | ❌ No    | ❌ No  |
| Easy to Use?                           | ✅ Super easy | ✅ Yes |

| Automation Engine?                     | ❌ No    | ❌ No  |
| Language Support                       | ❌ English only | ✅ Multiple languages |

Granola might appeal to individuals or small businesses looking for a simple and user-friendly tool for managing in-person meetings and local recordings. However, it lacks integrations with popular platforms like Zoom and Calendar, limiting its usefulness for those who rely on these tools for scheduling and communication.

Krisp could be a good fit for users who prioritize language support and accessibility across different devices, such as Mac and Windows computers, and iPhone and Android smartphones. Nevertheless, its lack of integrations with widely-used platforms like HubSpot and Notion, as well as the absence of an automation engine, may hinder its ability to truly streamline and enhance the meeting experience for users.
