# Granola vs. Krisp – Which should you choose?  
AI meeting notes platforms provide four primary deliverables:  
  
* Transcripts create a word-for-word record of the meeting. For example, a one-hour product development meeting generates a searchable document containing every feature discussion, technical requirement, and team decision.  
* Action items are pulled directly from the conversation. When someone says "John will update the wireframes by Friday," the AI automatically creates a tracked task with the assignee and deadline.  
* Meeting summaries distill hour-long conversations into 2-3 paragraphs. A 45-minute sprint planning meeting becomes a concise overview of sprint goals, resource allocation, and key decisions.  
* Topic segmentation breaks discussions into labeled sections. A client call covering multiple projects is automatically divided into sections like "Website Redesign," "Q1 Marketing Campaign," and "Budget Review."  
  
In addition to the quality of these deliverables, we'll want to look at a number of other key factors:  
  
* Free trial: can you test it for free before committing?  
* Ease-of-use: does it have a simple, intuitive setup that works for non-technical users?  
* In-person meeting support: can it transcribe audio from live recordings or uploaded files, not just virtual calls?  
* Security and privacy: how is customer data handled on the platform?  
* Integrations: can it connect with your existing stack, like HubSpot, Notion, or Slack?  
* Functionality: does it go beyond transcriptions and actually help you take action?  
* Languages: can it transcribe and summarize meetings in different languages?  
* Desktop and mobile apps: can you access it on Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android for on-the-go meetings?  
* Recordings: is there support for saving and playing back audio and video recordings of meetings?    
## Evaluating Granola and Krisp  
### Granola
* Granola functions as an automated note-taking tool that works in the background of meetings and produces organized summaries that can be customized through templates, with a simple interface similar to Apple Notes. The tool operates without interrupting meetings and captures notes through system audio, though it currently only works on Mac and lacks mobile apps.

### Krisp
* Krisp combines noise cancellation technology with AI note-taking capabilities, allowing users to remove background sounds and automatically generate meeting summaries with action items. The tool can experience audio distortion with loud noises, uses significant CPU resources, limits free noise cancellation to 60 minutes daily, and some users find the full version expensive.  
## Comparison table    
Krisp makes sense for larger companies who need to record in-person meetings and care about security compliance, though its limited integration options mean you'll still need other tools to make those recordings useful. The desktop app works well enough for basic recording and noise cancellation needs, but you won't get much help turning meetings into actual outcomes.

Granola could work for small teams or freelancers who just need simple remote meeting recordings without much fuss about security or in-person sessions. While it handles the basics of capturing and transcribing calls, you'll find yourself manually doing most of the post-meeting work since it lacks meaningful integrations and automation capabilities.
