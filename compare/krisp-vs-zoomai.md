# Krisp vs Zoom AI for meeting automation

Krisp is a voice enhancement tool that functions as an audio filter, removing background noises like dog barks, keyboard clicks, and echo from microphone or speaker output across communication apps. It has expanded beyond noise cancellation to include meeting recording, transcription in 90+ languages, and AI-generated summaries with key points and action items. The software works with any voice application through a desktop app for Windows and Mac.

The service offers a free plan with 60 minutes daily of noise cancellation and two meeting summaries, while paid tiers (starting at $8/month) provide unlimited usage. Krisp works for both online and offline conversations, recording locally without requiring a bot. It includes calendar integration for one-click recording and HubSpot CRM integration, though some users report occasional audio distortion, high CPU usage, and mixed experiences with customer support.

Zoom AI is a built-in AI assistant integrated directly into the Zoom platform. It automatically generates meeting summaries and action items after calls, allows participants to ask questions during meetings to catch up on missed content, and helps with composing emails and documents related to meetings. These features come included with paid Zoom subscriptions without additional cost, making it a seamless extension for existing users who want AI assistance without switching apps.

The tool only works within Zoom meetings and cannot capture in-person conversations or be used with other meeting platforms. While it offers live transcription in over 30 languages and functions on both desktop and mobile Zoom apps, it has limited integration capabilities outside the Zoom ecosystem. Free Zoom users have restricted access to these AI features, and some users report that certain capabilities like chat integration are still basic compared to dedicated meeting assistant tools.

## Comparing Krisp and Zoom AI

### Krisp

* Krisp functions as both a noise cancellation tool and meeting assistant, working across multiple communication platforms. It removes background noise and echo while also providing transcription and AI summaries with action items. The tool lacks robust integrations beyond basic calendar and CRM connections, limiting its potential to help users fully capitalize on meeting outcomes.

* The pricing structure includes a free plan with 60 minutes of daily noise cancellation and limited summaries, with paid tiers starting at $8/month for unlimited features. While Krisp works with any communication app and supports 90+ languages for transcription, its lack of mobile support and limited automation capabilities restrict its utility for teams needing comprehensive meeting workflow solutions.

### Zoom AI

* Zoom AI provides built-in meeting intelligence features exclusively for Zoom's platform, generating summaries and action items after calls. Users can ask the AI questions during meetings and get assistance with composing related communications, but the tool's platform-specific nature severely limits its usefulness across the broader meeting ecosystem.

* The feature comes included with paid Zoom subscriptions at no additional cost, making it economical for existing subscribers. While offering good language support and mobile functionality, Zoom AI's limited external integrations and constrained automation capabilities prevent it from truly helping users maximize their meeting productivity and follow-through.

Krisp is best suited for users who participate in meetings across multiple platforms and work in noisy environments. Its cross-platform functionality and superior noise cancellation make it valuable for remote workers, freelancers, and professionals who need flexibility across communication tools. The ability to capture in-person conversations also makes it useful for those who alternate between virtual and physical meetings.

Zoom AI makes the most sense for organizations already heavily invested in the Zoom ecosystem who primarily conduct meetings on that platform. Teams looking for the simplest solution with no additional app to install will appreciate its seamless integration, and budget-conscious organizations benefit from getting AI features at no extra cost beyond their existing Zoom subscription. However, both tools would better serve users with deeper integrations into productivity workflows.

## Krisp vs Zoom AI: What do users say?

Krisp is an AI voice enhancement tool with robust noise cancellation capabilities that remove background sounds like dog barks, keyboard clatter, and echo from audio in real-time. It functions across communication apps as an audio filter and has expanded to include meeting transcription and AI-generated summaries with key points and action items. Users consistently praise Krisp's effective noise removal and ease of use, describing it as a workflow essential that "just works." The AI note-taking feature has been well-received for its accuracy. However, some users report occasional audio distortion, voice clipping with extremely loud noises, high CPU usage, and consider the pricing somewhat steep. The free plan offers 60 minutes of noise cancellation and two meeting summaries daily, while paid plans start at around $8/month for unlimited features. Krisp works for both online and offline conversations, records locally, integrates with calendars and HubSpot CRM, and supports 90+ languages, but is currently desktop-only. In contrast, Zoom AI is built directly into the Zoom platform for paid subscribers at no extra cost, automatically generating meeting summaries and action items after calls. It allows participants to ask questions during meetings and assists with composing emails and documents. The seamless integration within Zoom is appreciated, though it only works with Zoom meetings, limiting its utility for users of other platforms. Some users find certain features less developed compared to dedicated tools, with limited control over which meetings to record and basic integration with Zoom Chat.

## FAQs 
• Would Krisp work for in-person meetings? What about Zoom AI?
Yes, Krisp would work for in-person meetings as it "captures any conversation (online or offline) using noise-canceling audio on your device." Zoom AI would not work for in-person meetings as it "only works for virtual Zoom calls (cannot independently capture in-person audio)."

• What about meeting bots? Does either of these tools require a meeting bot?
Krisp does not require a meeting bot as it "records & transcribes meetings locally via the Krisp app (no bot; works with any voice app)." The context doesn't specifically mention whether Zoom AI requires a meeting bot.

• What do users say about the quality of transcriptions?
The context doesn't provide specific user feedback about the quality of transcriptions for either tool. For Krisp, there's mention that audio quirks might "affect transcription accuracy" when trying to cancel very loud noises, but no direct feedback about transcription quality. For Zoom AI, there's no specific mention of transcription quality in the user reviews provided.
