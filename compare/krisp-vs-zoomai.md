# Krisp vs Zoom AI – Feature and product comparison

AI meeting notes platforms provide four primary deliverables:
* Transcripts that create a word-for-word record of the meeting. For example, a one-hour product development meeting generates a searchable document containing every feature discussion, technical requirement, and team decision.
* Action items are pulled directly from the conversation. When someone says "John will update the wireframes by Friday," the AI automatically creates a tracked task with the assignee and deadline.
* Meeting summaries distill hour-long conversations into 2-3 paragraphs. A 45-minute sprint planning meeting becomes a concise overview of sprint goals, resource allocation, and key decisions.
* Topic segmentation breaks discussions into labeled sections. A client call covering multiple projects is automatically divided into sections like "Website Redesign," "Q1 Marketing Campaign," and "Budget Review."

In addition to the quality of these deliverables, we'll want to look at a number of other key factors:
* Ease-of-use: does it have a simple, intuitive setup that works for non-technical users?
* In-person meeting support: can it transcribe audio from live recordings or uploaded files, not just virtual calls?
* Security and privacy: how is customer data handled on the platform?
* Integrations: can it connect with your existing stack, like HubSpot, Notion, or Slack?
* Functionality: does it go beyond transcriptions and actually help you take action?
* Languages: can it transcribe and summarize meetings in different languages?
* Desktop and mobile apps: can you access it on Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android for on-the-go meetings?

## About Krisp
Krisp is a voice enhancement tool that functions as an audio filter, removing background noises like dog barks, keyboard clicks, and echo from microphone or speaker output across communication apps. It has expanded beyond noise cancellation to include meeting recording, transcription in 90+ languages, and AI-generated summaries with key points and action items. The software works with any voice application through a desktop app for Windows and Mac.

The service offers a free plan with 60 minutes daily of noise cancellation and two meeting summaries, while paid tiers (starting at $8/month) provide unlimited usage. Krisp works for both online and offline conversations, recording locally without requiring a bot. It includes calendar integration for one-click recording and HubSpot CRM integration, though some users report occasional audio distortion, high CPU usage, and mixed experiences with customer support.

## About Zoom AI
Zoom AI is a built-in AI assistant integrated directly into the Zoom platform. It automatically generates meeting summaries and action items after calls, allows participants to ask questions during meetings to catch up on missed content, and helps with composing emails and documents related to meetings. These features come included with paid Zoom subscriptions without additional cost, making it a seamless extension for existing users who want AI assistance without switching apps.

The tool only works within Zoom meetings and cannot capture in-person conversations or be used with other meeting platforms. While it offers live transcription in over 30 languages and functions on both desktop and mobile Zoom apps, it has limited integration capabilities outside the Zoom ecosystem. Free Zoom users have restricted access to these AI features, and some users report that certain capabilities like chat integration are still basic compared to dedicated meeting assistant tools.

## Comparison
### Krisp

* Krisp functions as both a noise cancellation tool and meeting assistant, working across multiple communication platforms. It removes background noise and echo while also providing transcription and AI summaries with action items. The tool lacks robust integrations beyond basic calendar and CRM connections, limiting its potential to help users fully capitalize on meeting outcomes.

* The pricing structure includes a free plan with 60 minutes of daily noise cancellation and limited summaries, with paid tiers starting at $8/month for unlimited features. While Krisp works with any communication app and supports 90+ languages for transcription, its lack of mobile support and limited automation capabilities restrict its utility for teams needing comprehensive meeting workflow solutions.

### Zoom AI

* Zoom AI provides built-in meeting intelligence features exclusively for Zoom's platform, generating summaries and action items after calls. Users can ask the AI questions during meetings and get assistance with composing related communications, but the tool's platform-specific nature severely limits its usefulness across the broader meeting ecosystem.

* The feature comes included with paid Zoom subscriptions at no additional cost, making it economical for existing subscribers. While offering good language support and mobile functionality, Zoom AI's limited external integrations and constrained automation capabilities prevent it from truly helping users maximize their meeting productivity and follow-through.

|---------|-------|---------|
| Platform support | Cross-platform ✅ | Zoom-only ❌ |
| Noise cancellation | Advanced ✅ | Basic ❌ |
| In-person meetings | Supported ✅ | Not supported ❌ |
| Local recording | Full support ✅ | Partial support ❌ |
| External integrations | Limited ❌ | Very limited ❌ |

Krisp is best suited for users who participate in meetings across multiple platforms and work in noisy environments. Its cross-platform functionality and superior noise cancellation make it valuable for remote workers, freelancers, and professionals who need flexibility across communication tools. The ability to capture in-person conversations also makes it useful for those who alternate between virtual and physical meetings.

Zoom AI makes the most sense for organizations already heavily invested in the Zoom ecosystem who primarily conduct meetings on that platform. Teams looking for the simplest solution with no additional app to install will appreciate its seamless integration, and budget-conscious organizations benefit from getting AI features at no extra cost beyond their existing Zoom subscription. However, both tools would better serve users with deeper integrations into productivity workflows.
