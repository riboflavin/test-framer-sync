# tldv vs Avoma for meeting automation

Here's what you should look for in an AI meeting automation tool:  
* Transcripts that create a word-for-word record of the meeting. For example, a one-hour product development meeting generates a searchable document containing every feature discussion, technical requirement, and team decision.
* [Action items](/releases/add-action-items-to-meetings) are pulled directly from the conversation. When someone says "John will update the wireframes by Friday," the AI automatically creates a tracked task with the assignee and deadline.
* Meeting summaries distill hour-long conversations into 2-3 paragraphs. A 45-minute sprint planning meeting becomes a concise overview of sprint goals, resource allocation, and key decisions.
* Topic segmentation breaks discussions into labeled sections. A client call covering multiple projects is automatically divided into sections like "Website Redesign," "Q1 Marketing Campaign," and "Budget Review."

## Other key features
In addition to the quality of these deliverables, we'll want to look at a number of other key factors:
* Ease-of-use: does it have a simple, intuitive setup that works for non-technical users?
* In-person meeting support: can it transcribe audio from live recordings or uploaded files, not just virtual calls?
* Security and privacy: how is customer data handled on the platform?
* Integrations: can it connect with your existing stack, like HubSpot, Notion, or Slack?
* Functionality: does it go beyond transcriptions and actually help you take action?
* Languages: can it transcribe and summarize meetings in different languages?
* Desktop and mobile apps: can you access it on Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android for on-the-go meetings?

## Understanding tldv and Avoma
Tldv is a meeting productivity tool that records, transcribes, and summarizes conversations across video conferencing platforms. It provides timestamps, highlights, and CRM integration capabilities, with AI agents handling recording, note-taking, and CRM logging functions. The system supports over 30 languages and offers local recording through desktop applications for Zoom and Microsoft Teams.

The service operates with a tiered pricing model: a free tier and paid options at $18/month (Pro) and $59/month (Business). It offers desktop applications for Windows and macOS but lacks a native mobile app. Tldv connects with HubSpot, Notion, Salesforce and claims integration with 5,000+ other services. The platform requires internet connectivity for optimal performance and has limited support for in-person meetings.

Avoma is an AI meeting assistant that records, transcribes, and summarizes meetings. It organizes notes by topics such as pain points and next steps, captures meeting information into CRMs like Salesforce and HubSpot, and supports agenda templates and live note collaboration. The platform works for both online meetings and in-person conversations through its mobile app, offers approximately 95% transcription accuracy, and supports 20+ languages.

The service is structured across multiple tiers: a free plan limited to about 10 meetings monthly, and paid plans ranging from $19 to $129 per user per month. Avoma integrates with calendars, CRMs, and other tools via Zapier, and automates note-taking, follow-up emails, and data entry. It's web-based with iOS and Android mobile apps but lacks a dedicated desktop application.

## Comparing tldv and Avoma

### tldv

* tldv offers AI meeting recording, transcription, and summarization with integrations to various tools like HubSpot and Notion. While it provides accurate transcriptions and an intuitive UI, the tool struggles with limited platform support and relies heavily on internet quality.
* The service comes with a free plan and paid options starting at $18/month, supporting over 30 languages through a desktop app. Despite its extensive integration claims, tldv's connections lack depth needed for truly streamlining workflows, and users must still manually process most meeting outputs.

### Avoma

* Avoma functions as an all-in-one meeting assistant that records, transcribes, and generates organized notes with topic breakdowns for sales and customer success teams. The platform offers strong transcription accuracy but can be overwhelming for users with simpler needs, with some reporting occasional bugs and speaker identification issues.
* Pricing ranges from free to $129/user/month with mobile app support for in-person recording and CRM synchronization. While Avoma connects with various tools, its integrations often fall short in meaningful automation, requiring users to still manage much of the post-meeting workflow manually.

| Local recording | ✅ | ✅ |
| Desktop app | ✅ | ❌ |

tldv is better suited for individual professionals and small teams seeking a straightforward, cost-effective meeting assistant with desktop functionality. Its simpler approach and lower price point make it accessible for those who prioritize basic transcription and note-taking without needing complex features or mobile capabilities.

Avoma caters to sales teams and customer-facing departments in mid-sized organizations that require more comprehensive meeting documentation. Its ability to handle in-person meetings through mobile apps and deeper CRM integration makes it valuable for companies tracking customer interactions, though the premium pricing reflects this enterprise focus.
