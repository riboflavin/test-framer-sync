# Krisp vs. Read.ai – Which should you choose?  
AI meeting notes platforms provide four primary deliverables:  
  
* Transcripts create a word-for-word record of the meeting. For example, a one-hour product development meeting generates a searchable document containing every feature discussion, technical requirement, and team decision.  
* Action items are pulled directly from the conversation. When someone says "John will update the wireframes by Friday," the AI automatically creates a tracked task with the assignee and deadline.  
* Meeting summaries distill hour-long conversations into 2-3 paragraphs. A 45-minute sprint planning meeting becomes a concise overview of sprint goals, resource allocation, and key decisions.  
* Topic segmentation breaks discussions into labeled sections. A client call covering multiple projects is automatically divided into sections like "Website Redesign," "Q1 Marketing Campaign," and "Budget Review."  
  
In addition to the quality of these deliverables, we'll want to look at a number of other key factors:  
  
* Free trial: can you test it for free before committing?  
* Ease-of-use: does it have a simple, intuitive setup that works for non-technical users?  
* In-person meeting support: can it transcribe audio from live recordings or uploaded files, not just virtual calls?  
* Security and privacy: how is customer data handled on the platform?  
* Integrations: can it connect with your existing stack, like HubSpot, Notion, or Slack?  
* Functionality: does it go beyond transcriptions and actually help you take action?  
* Languages: can it transcribe and summarize meetings in different languages?  
* Desktop and mobile apps: can you access it on Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android for on-the-go meetings?  
* Recordings: is there support for saving and playing back audio and video recordings of meetings?    
## Evaluating Krisp and Read.ai  
### Krisp
* Krisp combines noise cancellation with AI note-taking, offering audio cleanup during calls and automated meeting summaries with action items. The software is simple to operate with a toggle switch and integrates into existing workflows, though free usage is capped at 60 minutes daily.
* The system can sometimes distort voices or clip words when dealing with loud background noise, which impacts transcription quality. Users report high CPU usage during operation, and some find the Pro version pricing steep, particularly when needing only specific features.

### Read.ai
* Read.ai provides meeting transcription, engagement analytics, and multi-language support with real-time translation, plus integrations with Slack, Notion, and Confluence. The platform includes meeting quality metrics and speaker balance analysis, with particular optimization for Zoom users.
* The free tier limits users to 5 meetings monthly, and the interface requires time to learn due to feature density. Technical issues can affect engagement metrics accuracy when participants join late or have audio problems, and some users raise privacy concerns about unauthorized meeting monitoring.  
## Comparison table    
Krisp makes sense for remote teams who want a desktop-first experience and don't need mobile apps or in-person meeting support. The tool works well enough for basic meeting recording and transcription, though its integrations are basic and it can't help automate any meeting-related tasks.

Read.ai fits teams who need both in-person and remote meeting coverage, especially if they want mobile access to their recordings and transcripts. While it handles the fundamentals and offers similar integration options to Krisp, it also lacks meaningful automation capabilities that could help teams actually execute on their meeting outcomes.
