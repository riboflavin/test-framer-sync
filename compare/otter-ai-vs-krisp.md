# Otter.ai vs. Krisp – Which should you choose?  
AI meeting notes platforms provide four primary deliverables:  
  
* Transcripts create a word-for-word record of the meeting. For example, a one-hour product development meeting generates a searchable document containing every feature discussion, technical requirement, and team decision.  
* Action items are pulled directly from the conversation. When someone says "John will update the wireframes by Friday," the AI automatically creates a tracked task with the assignee and deadline.  
* Meeting summaries distill hour-long conversations into 2-3 paragraphs. A 45-minute sprint planning meeting becomes a concise overview of sprint goals, resource allocation, and key decisions.  
* Topic segmentation breaks discussions into labeled sections. A client call covering multiple projects is automatically divided into sections like "Website Redesign," "Q1 Marketing Campaign," and "Budget Review."  
  
In addition to the quality of these deliverables, we'll want to look at a number of other key factors:  
  
* Free trial: can you test it for free before committing?  
* Ease-of-use: does it have a simple, intuitive setup that works for non-technical users?  
* In-person meeting support: can it transcribe audio from live recordings or uploaded files, not just virtual calls?  
* Security and privacy: how is customer data handled on the platform?  
* Integrations: can it connect with your existing stack, like HubSpot, Notion, or Slack?  
* Functionality: does it go beyond transcriptions and actually help you take action?  
* Languages: can it transcribe and summarize meetings in different languages?  
* Desktop and mobile apps: can you access it on Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android for on-the-go meetings?  
* Recordings: is there support for saving and playing back audio and video recordings of meetings?    
## Evaluating Otter.ai and Krisp  
### Otter.ai
- Easy to use; intuitive interface and live editing of transcripts.
- Strong free plan with generous transcription limits.
- Seamless integration with Zoom & calendar for auto-recording meetings.
- Transcription errors with accents or fast speech (not as accurate as human).
- Only supports English, which is limiting.
- Speaker ID can be hit-or-miss, requiring manual fixes in notes.

### Krisp
- Excellent noise cancellation for both microphone and speaker audio.
- Platform-agnostic – use with any meeting software, even phone calls.
- Unlimited transcription on all plans (no minute caps).
- Generous free plan (includes noise reduction and a couple summaries/day).
- Custom vocabulary improves accuracy for industry terms.
- Free plan limits: 60 min/day noise removal, 2 summaries/day.
- Summaries are concise but not as in-depth as some competitors’ (geared toward quick recap).
- No real-time collab or multi-user features – it’s a personal tool (teams would each use their own instance).
- Can tax system resources during long meetings (CPU usage for AI processing).  
## Comparison table    
Some individuals or organizations may find Otter.ai appealing due to its Zoom and calendar integration, as well as its availability on both iPhone and Android. However, Otter.ai lacks depth in integrations with other platforms like HubSpot and Notion, limiting its overall utility for users seeking a comprehensive meeting solution. Similarly, Krisp may attract users with its ease of use and support for local recording, but its lack of integrations with popular tools and absence of an automation engine may hinder its effectiveness in enhancing meeting productivity.

Both Otter.ai and Krisp fall short in terms of integration depth, limiting their ability to fully assist users in optimizing their meeting experiences. While Otter.ai offers language support and Krisp provides a desktop app for Mac and Windows, the absence of key integrations and automation capabilities may leave users wanting more in terms of meeting efficiency and productivity.
