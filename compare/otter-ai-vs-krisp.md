# Otter.ai vs. Krisp: Which should you choose?
AI meeting notes platforms provide four primary deliverables:

• Transcripts create a word-for-word record of the meeting. For example, a one-hour product development meeting generates a searchable document containing every feature discussion, technical requirement, and team decision.
• Action items are pulled directly from the conversation. When someone says "John will update the wireframes by Friday," the AI automatically creates a tracked task with the assignee and deadline.
• Meeting summaries distill hour-long conversations into 2-3 paragraphs. A 45-minute sprint planning meeting becomes a concise overview of sprint goals, resource allocation, and key decisions.
• Topic segmentation breaks discussions into labeled sections. A client call covering multiple projects is automatically divided into sections like "Website Redesign," "Q1 Marketing Campaign," and "Budget Review."

In addition to the quality of these deliverables, we'll want to look at a number of other key factors:

• Free trial: can you test it for free before committing?
• Ease-of-use: does it have a simple, intuitive setup that works for non-technical users?
• In-person meeting support: can it transcribe audio from live recordings or uploaded files, not just virtual calls?
• Security and privacy: how is customer data handled on the platform?
• Integrations: can it connect with your existing stack, like HubSpot, Notion, or Slack?
• Functionality: does it go beyond transcriptions and actually help you take action?
• Languages: can it transcribe and summarize meetings in different languages?
• Desktop and mobile apps: can you access it on Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android for on-the-go meeitngs?
• Recordings: is there support for saving and playing back audio and video recordings of meetings?
## Evaluating Otter.ai and Krisp
Otter.ai: Easy to use with live editing, strong free plan with generous limits, integrates with Zoom & calendar. However, accuracy issues with accents/fast speech, English-only support, hit-or-miss speaker ID.

Krisp: Excellent noise cancellation, platform-agnostic, unlimited transcription, generous free plan. Limitations include daily caps on noise removal and summaries, less in-depth summaries, no real-time collaboration, and potential system resource strain during long meetings.

Otter.ai might appeal to individuals or companies looking for a free and easy-to-use tool with support for multiple languages and mobile apps. However, its limitations in integrations with popular platforms like HubSpot and Notion, as well as its lack of features for in-person meetings and local recording, may hinder its effectiveness in enhancing productivity during meetings.

On the other hand, Krisp could be suitable for users seeking a straightforward and free solution that integrates seamlessly with Zoom and calendars, and offers desktop apps for both Mac and Windows. Yet, its shortcomings in integrations with other tools, absence of an automation engine, and limited support for in-person meetings may limit its ability to fully assist users in optimizing their meeting experiences.
