# Fireflies.ai vs. Zoom AI – Which should you choose?  
AI meeting notes platforms provide four primary deliverables:  
  
* Transcripts create a word-for-word record of the meeting. For example, a one-hour product development meeting generates a searchable document containing every feature discussion, technical requirement, and team decision.  
* Action items are pulled directly from the conversation. When someone says "John will update the wireframes by Friday," the AI automatically creates a tracked task with the assignee and deadline.  
* Meeting summaries distill hour-long conversations into 2-3 paragraphs. A 45-minute sprint planning meeting becomes a concise overview of sprint goals, resource allocation, and key decisions.  
* Topic segmentation breaks discussions into labeled sections. A client call covering multiple projects is automatically divided into sections like "Website Redesign," "Q1 Marketing Campaign," and "Budget Review."  
  
In addition to the quality of these deliverables, we'll want to look at a number of other key factors:  
  
* Free trial: can you test it for free before committing?  
* Ease-of-use: does it have a simple, intuitive setup that works for non-technical users?  
* In-person meeting support: can it transcribe audio from live recordings or uploaded files, not just virtual calls?  
* Security and privacy: how is customer data handled on the platform?  
* Integrations: can it connect with your existing stack, like HubSpot, Notion, or Slack?  
* Functionality: does it go beyond transcriptions and actually help you take action?  
* Languages: can it transcribe and summarize meetings in different languages?  
* Desktop and mobile apps: can you access it on Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android for on-the-go meetings?  
* Recordings: is there support for saving and playing back audio and video recordings of meetings?    
## Evaluating Fireflies.ai and Zoom AI  
### Fireflies.ai
* Fireflies.ai works across multiple meeting platforms and offers transcription, summaries, and action items within minutes after calls, with CRM integrations and a mobile app. The free tier provides basic features, while paid tiers unlock video recording and advanced capabilities.
* Transcription accuracy varies with accents and technical terms, and summaries can miss nuanced details or original phrasing. The interface has some clutter issues, and users report excessive notifications.

### Zoom AI
* Zoom AI integrates directly into Zoom meetings with no extra setup, providing instant meeting summaries and action items, and comes included with paid Zoom accounts. The tool operates automatically once enabled, handling meeting content tracking within the platform.
* The service only functions within Zoom meetings, not other platforms, and free users face the standard 40-minute meeting limit. Features like meeting management controls and chat integration are limited, with some users reporting difficulties sharing AI notes outside Zoom.  
## Comparison table    
Small teams and freelancers who meet in person often and need basic integrations with common work tools should use Fireflies. While its automation features aren't comprehensive, it works across platforms and offers a free tier to test things out.

Large companies already using Zoom who just need basic recording and transcription should stick with Zoom AI. The desktop app and built-in security make it convenient, though the lack of integrations and limited automation capabilities mean teams will still need to manually handle most post-meeting tasks.
