# Fireflies.ai vs. Zoom AI – Which should you choose?  
AI meeting notes platforms provide four primary deliverables:  
  
* Transcripts create a word-for-word record of the meeting. For example, a one-hour product development meeting generates a searchable document containing every feature discussion, technical requirement, and team decision.  
* Action items are pulled directly from the conversation. When someone says "John will update the wireframes by Friday," the AI automatically creates a tracked task with the assignee and deadline.  
* Meeting summaries distill hour-long conversations into 2-3 paragraphs. A 45-minute sprint planning meeting becomes a concise overview of sprint goals, resource allocation, and key decisions.  
* Topic segmentation breaks discussions into labeled sections. A client call covering multiple projects is automatically divided into sections like "Website Redesign," "Q1 Marketing Campaign," and "Budget Review."  
  
In addition to the quality of these deliverables, we'll want to look at a number of other key factors:  
  
* Free trial: can you test it for free before committing?  
* Ease-of-use: does it have a simple, intuitive setup that works for non-technical users?  
* In-person meeting support: can it transcribe audio from live recordings or uploaded files, not just virtual calls?  
* Security and privacy: how is customer data handled on the platform?  
* Integrations: can it connect with your existing stack, like HubSpot, Notion, or Slack?  
* Functionality: does it go beyond transcriptions and actually help you take action?  
* Languages: can it transcribe and summarize meetings in different languages?  
* Desktop and mobile apps: can you access it on Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android for on-the-go meetings?  
* Recordings: is there support for saving and playing back audio and video recordings of meetings?    
## Evaluating Fireflies.ai and Zoom AI  
### Fireflies.ai
* Fireflies.ai works across multiple meeting platforms and provides transcripts, summaries, action items, and analytics features like sentiment analysis and keyword tracking, with automated bot setup and email notifications. The service has usage limits on free plans, shows occasional transcription errors with accents and specialized terms, includes a feature-heavy interface that takes time to learn, and sends frequent meeting recap emails.

### Zoom AI
* Zoom AI integrates directly into Zoom meetings with real-time AI assistance, whiteboard features, and meeting summaries, requiring no additional setup for Zoom users and included with paid Zoom subscriptions. The tool only works within Zoom platform, requires a paid Zoom plan, cannot identify speakers who aren't logged in, and lacks custom vocabulary options for specialized terminology.  
## Comparison table    
Small teams and startups that need flexible meeting tools and want to connect their notes to other apps will prefer Fireflies.ai, despite its limited integration depth. The free plan and multi-language support make it accessible, while basic automation features help teams stay organized even if they can't fully automate their workflows.

Large companies already using Zoom who want simple, reliable meeting features will naturally gravitate to Zoom AI, even though it lacks meaningful integrations with other business tools. The native integration with Zoom and desktop apps provide familiarity and ease of use, but users will find themselves manually moving information between systems.
