# Fireflies.ai vs. Zoom AI: Which should you choose?
AI meeting notes platforms provide four primary deliverables:

• Transcripts create a word-for-word record of the meeting. For example, a one-hour product development meeting generates a searchable document containing every feature discussion, technical requirement, and team decision.
• Action items are pulled directly from the conversation. When someone says "John will update the wireframes by Friday," the AI automatically creates a tracked task with the assignee and deadline.
• Meeting summaries distill hour-long conversations into 2-3 paragraphs. A 45-minute sprint planning meeting becomes a concise overview of sprint goals, resource allocation, and key decisions.
• Topic segmentation breaks discussions into labeled sections. A client call covering multiple projects is automatically divided into sections like "Website Redesign," "Q1 Marketing Campaign," and "Budget Review."

In addition to the quality of these deliverables, we'll want to look at a number of other key factors:

• Free trial: can you test it for free before committing?
• Ease-of-use: does it have a simple, intuitive setup that works for non-technical users?
• In-person meeting support: can it transcribe audio from live recordings or uploaded files, not just virtual calls?
• Security and privacy: how is customer data handled on the platform?
• Integrations: can it connect with your existing stack, like HubSpot, Notion, or Slack?
• Functionality: does it go beyond transcriptions and actually help you take action?
• Languages: can it transcribe and summarize meetings in different languages?
• Desktop and mobile apps: can you access it on Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android for on-the-go meeitngs?
• Recordings: is there support for saving and playing back audio and video recordings of meetings?
## Evaluating Fireflies.ai and Zoom AI
Fireflies.ai offers wide compatibility with various platforms, detailed meeting summaries, and a feature-rich experience for deeper insights. However, users have noted limitations on the free plan, transcription accuracy issues, a cluttered UI, and excessive email notifications. On the other hand, Zoom AI provides native integration with Zoom, real-time Q&A during meetings, and a unique whiteboard AI feature. Yet, it is restricted to Zoom usage only, requires a paid Zoom plan, has speaker ID limitations, and may struggle with industry-specific jargon during transcription.

Fireflies.ai might be suitable for individuals or companies looking for a tool with a free plan and integrations with platforms like HubSpot and Notion. However, it lacks depth in integrations and may not be the most effective in helping users with their meeting tasks. On the other hand, Zoom AI could be appealing to those who prioritize Zoom and calendar integration, but it also falls short in terms of integrations and practical meeting assistance.

Both Fireflies.ai and Zoom AI have limitations in their integrations and may not fully support users in efficiently managing their meetings.
