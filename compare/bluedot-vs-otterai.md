# Bluedot vs Otter.ai for meeting automation

Here's what you should look for in an AI meeting automation tool:  
* Transcripts that create a word-for-word record of the meeting. For example, a one-hour product development meeting generates a searchable document containing every feature discussion, technical requirement, and team decision.
* [Action items](/releases/add-action-items-to-meetings) are pulled directly from the conversation. When someone says "John will update the wireframes by Friday," the AI automatically creates a tracked task with the assignee and deadline.
* Meeting summaries distill hour-long conversations into 2-3 paragraphs. A 45-minute sprint planning meeting becomes a concise overview of sprint goals, resource allocation, and key decisions.
* Topic segmentation breaks discussions into labeled sections. A client call covering multiple projects is automatically divided into sections like "Website Redesign," "Q1 Marketing Campaign," and "Budget Review."

## Other key features
In addition to the quality of these deliverables, we'll want to look at a number of other key factors:
* Ease-of-use: does it have a simple, intuitive setup that works for non-technical users?
* In-person meeting support: can it transcribe audio from live recordings or uploaded files, not just virtual calls?
* Security and privacy: how is customer data handled on the platform?
* Integrations: can it connect with your existing stack, like HubSpot, Notion, or Slack?
* Functionality: does it go beyond transcriptions and actually help you take action?
* Languages: can it transcribe and summarize meetings in different languages?
* Desktop and mobile apps: can you access it on Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android for on-the-go meetings?

## Understanding Bluedot and Otter.ai
Bluedot is an AI meeting recorder and transcription tool that works via Chrome extension, eliminating the need for meeting bots. It records meetings from Google Meet, Zoom, Microsoft Teams and other platforms, generating real-time transcripts in over 100 languages. The tool automatically syncs meeting notes to external systems like Salesforce, HubSpot, Notion, Slack, and Google Docs with one-click integration.

The service operates on a tiered pricing model, with only 5 free meetings available as a trial. Paid plans start at $18/month for unlimited audio-only recordings (1-hour max per meeting), while higher tiers ($25-40/month) add features like unlimited video recording, longer meetings, custom templates, and CRM integrations. Bluedot works on desktop through Chrome and has recently added desktop apps for Windows/Mac, though mobile support isn't yet available.

Otter.ai is an AI note-taking tool that provides live transcription for meetings, classes and interviews. It captures audio in real-time, identifies speakers, and generates automatic summaries and highlights from conversations. The service integrates with platforms like Zoom and Microsoft Teams through an assistant that joins meetings, and offers searchable, shareable transcripts. Users can record audio directly through web or mobile apps for non-meeting conversations.

The platform operates on a tiered pricing model starting with a free plan offering 600 minutes of transcription monthly. Paid options include Premium ($10/month annually) with 6,000 minutes, Business ($20/user/month) with team sharing and admin controls, and Enterprise plans for larger organizations. Otter supports primarily English with some Spanish and French capability, and functions through web browsers, mobile apps for iOS and Android, and platform integrations rather than a dedicated desktop application.

## Comparing Bluedot and Otter.ai

### Bluedot

* Bluedot offers accurate transcription through a Chrome extension without requiring a meeting bot. It works across major platforms like Zoom and Teams, and provides one-click sync to various systems, but lacks comprehensive integrations for true workflow automation. The free version limits users to only 5 meetings total, essentially functioning as just a trial.

* Pricing is steeper than competitors, with plans ranging from $14-$40 per user per month when billed annually. While Bluedot excels at discreet background recording that works even when you're not the host, it requires Chrome on desktop for optimal performance and has not yet developed mature mobile support.

### Otter.ai

* Otter.ai provides live transcription during meetings and processes audio uploads with automatic summaries, but has limited depth in its integration capabilities beyond basic connectivity. It offers a generous free tier (600 minutes/month) and paid plans starting at $10/month, making it more accessible for users on a budget.

* The tool struggles with accuracy in complex audio environments and transcripts can be overly verbose, making it difficult to quickly extract key information. While Otter works across platforms and offers mobile apps, it tends to function more as a recording solution than a comprehensive tool for actionable meeting outcomes.

| Feature | Bluedot | Otter.ai |
|---------|---------|----------|
| Transcription Accuracy | High accuracy ✅ | Variable accuracy ❌ |
| Free Plan | 5 meetings only ❌ | 600 min/month ✅ |
| Pricing (Annual) | $14-$40/user/month ❌ | $10-$20/user/month ✅ |
| Bot Required | No bot ✅ | Meeting bot ❌ |
| Language Support | 100+ languages ✅ | 3 languages ❌ |
| Mobile App | No app ❌ | iOS/Android apps ✅ |
| Desktop App | Windows/Mac app ✅ | Browser only ❌ |
| Integration Depth | Basic syncing ❌ | Basic syncing ❌ |

Bluedot is better suited for enterprise users and teams that prioritize transcription accuracy and discreet recording, particularly in sensitive meetings where bot presence might be awkward. Its higher price point and Chrome dependency make it less ideal for budget-conscious users or organizations with strict browser policies, but its extensive language support makes it valuable for international teams.

Otter.ai works best for individual users, small teams, and educational contexts where budget constraints are significant and mobile access is important. Its generous free tier provides an accessible entry point, though teams requiring high accuracy or working in noisy environments might find its transcription quality insufficient. Neither tool fully addresses the challenge of turning meeting content into actionable workflow steps beyond basic note-taking.
