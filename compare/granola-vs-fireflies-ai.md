# Granola vs. Fireflies.ai – Which should you choose?  
AI meeting notes platforms provide four primary deliverables:  
  
* Transcripts create a word-for-word record of the meeting. For example, a one-hour product development meeting generates a searchable document containing every feature discussion, technical requirement, and team decision.  
* Action items are pulled directly from the conversation. When someone says "John will update the wireframes by Friday," the AI automatically creates a tracked task with the assignee and deadline.  
* Meeting summaries distill hour-long conversations into 2-3 paragraphs. A 45-minute sprint planning meeting becomes a concise overview of sprint goals, resource allocation, and key decisions.  
* Topic segmentation breaks discussions into labeled sections. A client call covering multiple projects is automatically divided into sections like "Website Redesign," "Q1 Marketing Campaign," and "Budget Review."  
  
In addition to the quality of these deliverables, we'll want to look at a number of other key factors:  
  
* Free trial: can you test it for free before committing?  
* Ease-of-use: does it have a simple, intuitive setup that works for non-technical users?  
* In-person meeting support: can it transcribe audio from live recordings or uploaded files, not just virtual calls?  
* Security and privacy: how is customer data handled on the platform?  
* Integrations: can it connect with your existing stack, like HubSpot, Notion, or Slack?  
* Functionality: does it go beyond transcriptions and actually help you take action?  
* Languages: can it transcribe and summarize meetings in different languages?  
* Desktop and mobile apps: can you access it on Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android for on-the-go meetings?  
* Recordings: is there support for saving and playing back audio and video recordings of meetings?    
## Evaluating Granola and Fireflies.ai  
### Granola
* Granola functions as a local note-taking app that transcribes meetings by listening on-device, without requiring a meeting bot, and includes custom templates for generating summaries. The app currently only works on MacOS, has limited integrations, and lacks multi-user collaboration features, requiring manual note sharing.

### Fireflies.ai
* Fireflies.ai operates via a meeting bot that works across major platforms like Zoom and Teams, automatically sending summaries and action items after meetings while offering features like keyword tracking and sentiment analysis. The service has usage limits on free plans, occasional transcription accuracy issues with accents, and sends frequent email notifications that some users find excessive.  
## Comparison table    
Small teams and freelancers who primarily do in-person meetings or local recordings would find Granola useful, though they'll need to handle follow-up tasks manually. The Mac-only desktop app is straightforward but lacks the integrations needed to make meeting outcomes truly actionable.

Larger organizations using Zoom and needing multi-language support would gravitate toward Fireflies.ai, especially if they're already using tools like HubSpot or Notion. While its automation features and mobile apps are helpful, being web-only and focused solely on virtual meetings limits its utility for hybrid teams.
