# Granola vs. Fireflies.ai: Which should you choose?  
AI meeting notes platforms provide four primary deliverables:  
  
* Transcripts create a word-for-word record of the meeting. For example, a one-hour product development meeting generates a searchable document containing every feature discussion, technical requirement, and team decision.  
* Action items are pulled directly from the conversation. When someone says "John will update the wireframes by Friday," the AI automatically creates a tracked task with the assignee and deadline.  
* Meeting summaries distill hour-long conversations into 2-3 paragraphs. A 45-minute sprint planning meeting becomes a concise overview of sprint goals, resource allocation, and key decisions.  
* Topic segmentation breaks discussions into labeled sections. A client call covering multiple projects is automatically divided into sections like "Website Redesign," "Q1 Marketing Campaign," and "Budget Review."  
  
In addition to the quality of these deliverables, we'll want to look at a number of other key factors:  
  
* Free trial: can you test it for free before committing?  
* Ease-of-use: does it have a simple, intuitive setup that works for non-technical users?  
* In-person meeting support: can it transcribe audio from live recordings or uploaded files, not just virtual calls?  
* Security and privacy: how is customer data handled on the platform?  
* Integrations: can it connect with your existing stack, like HubSpot, Notion, or Slack?  
* Functionality: does it go beyond transcriptions and actually help you take action?  
* Languages: can it transcribe and summarize meetings in different languages?  
* Desktop and mobile apps: can you access it on Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android for on-the-go meetings?  
* Recordings: is there support for saving and playing back audio and video recordings of meetings?    
## Evaluating Granola and Fireflies.ai  
Granola:
- Pros: Minimal, user-friendly app with custom templates for notes and accurate transcription quality.
- Cons: MacOS only, few integrations, lacks multi-user features, and some basic capabilities due to being a new product.

Fireflies.ai:
- Pros: Wide compatibility with various platforms, detailed summaries, feature-rich for deeper insights, and easy setup.
- Cons: Free plan limits, transcription accuracy around 90%, cluttered UI with a slight learning curve, and excessive email notifications.

**Granola**: Companies or individuals looking for a free trial and easy-to-use tool may find Granola appealing. However, those seeking deep integrations with tools like HubSpot and Notion, as well as automation capabilities, may be disappointed by its limitations.

**Fireflies.ai**: Users who prioritize Zoom and calendar integration, as well as multi-language support, may opt for Fireflies.ai. Nevertheless, individuals or businesses requiring in-person meeting support and local recording capabilities might find Fireflies.ai lacking in meeting their needs effectively.
