# Fireflies.ai vs. Avoma – Which should you choose?  
AI meeting notes platforms provide four primary deliverables:  
  
* Transcripts create a word-for-word record of the meeting. For example, a one-hour product development meeting generates a searchable document containing every feature discussion, technical requirement, and team decision.  
* Action items are pulled directly from the conversation. When someone says "John will update the wireframes by Friday," the AI automatically creates a tracked task with the assignee and deadline.  
* Meeting summaries distill hour-long conversations into 2-3 paragraphs. A 45-minute sprint planning meeting becomes a concise overview of sprint goals, resource allocation, and key decisions.  
* Topic segmentation breaks discussions into labeled sections. A client call covering multiple projects is automatically divided into sections like "Website Redesign," "Q1 Marketing Campaign," and "Budget Review."  
  
In addition to the quality of these deliverables, we'll want to look at a number of other key factors:  
  
* Free trial: can you test it for free before committing?  
* Ease-of-use: does it have a simple, intuitive setup that works for non-technical users?  
* In-person meeting support: can it transcribe audio from live recordings or uploaded files, not just virtual calls?  
* Security and privacy: how is customer data handled on the platform?  
* Integrations: can it connect with your existing stack, like HubSpot, Notion, or Slack?  
* Functionality: does it go beyond transcriptions and actually help you take action?  
* Languages: can it transcribe and summarize meetings in different languages?  
* Desktop and mobile apps: can you access it on Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android for on-the-go meetings?  
* Recordings: is there support for saving and playing back audio and video recordings of meetings?    
## Evaluating Fireflies.ai and Avoma  
### Fireflies.ai
* Fireflies works across major meeting platforms with automated bot joining, provides post-meeting summaries with action items, and includes features like keyword tracking, sentiment analysis, and task assignment capabilities. Storage limits on free plans are restrictive, transcription accuracy varies with accents, the interface requires learning time, and frequent email notifications can be overwhelming.

### Avoma
* Avoma delivers transcriptions with clear speaker identification, generates AI summaries, and integrates with CRM and calendar systems for workflow management. The service requires a paid subscription starting around $59-79 per user monthly, has a steeper learning curve for setup, and occasionally experiences delays or errors with bot joining and speaker identification.  
## Comparison table    
Fireflies.ai makes sense for small teams and freelancers who need a simple, free way to record and transcribe their online meetings in different languages. The tool's ease of use and free tier make it accessible, though its limited integration depth means you'll still need to do most of the post-meeting work manually.

Avoma targets larger sales teams and enterprises who can justify the paid-only pricing and don't mind the steeper learning curve. While it offers similar core features to Fireflies, its English-only limitation and basic integration capabilities mean teams still need other tools to fully operationalize their meeting insights.
