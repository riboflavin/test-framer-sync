# Fathom vs. Avoma: Which should you choose?
AI meeting notes platforms provide four primary deliverables:

• Transcripts create a word-for-word record of the meeting. For example, a one-hour product development meeting generates a searchable document containing every feature discussion, technical requirement, and team decision.
• Action items are pulled directly from the conversation. When someone says "John will update the wireframes by Friday," the AI automatically creates a tracked task with the assignee and deadline.
• Meeting summaries distill hour-long conversations into 2-3 paragraphs. A 45-minute sprint planning meeting becomes a concise overview of sprint goals, resource allocation, and key decisions.
• Topic segmentation breaks discussions into labeled sections. A client call covering multiple projects is automatically divided into sections like "Website Redesign," "Q1 Marketing Campaign," and "Budget Review."

In addition to the quality of these deliverables, we'll want to look at a number of other key factors:

• Free trial: can you test it for free before committing?
• Ease-of-use: does it have a simple, intuitive setup that works for non-technical users?
• In-person meeting support: can it transcribe audio from live recordings or uploaded files, not just virtual calls?
• Security and privacy: how is customer data handled on the platform?
• Integrations: can it connect with your existing stack, like HubSpot, Notion, or Slack?
• Functionality: does it go beyond transcriptions and actually help you take action?
• Languages: can it transcribe and summarize meetings in different languages?
• Desktop and mobile apps: can you access it on Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android for on-the-go meeitngs?
• Recordings: is there support for saving and playing back audio and video recordings of meetings?
## Evaluating Fathom and Avoma
Fathom offers top-notch accuracy in transcripts and quick, high-quality summaries for free, supporting multiple languages. However, it historically only supported Zoom, has some duplicate note issues, and lacks live collaboration features.

Avoma provides highly accurate transcriptions, excellent AI summaries, and clear speaker separation, with workflow integrations for follow-ups. However, it lacks a free tier, is expensive for full features, can be complex for new users, and the meeting bot may join late or miss speaker names.

Fathom might appeal to individuals or small businesses looking for a straightforward tool with free access and basic Zoom and calendar integration. However, its limitations in supporting in-person meetings and local recording could hinder its usefulness for those seeking a more comprehensive solution. While it integrates with popular platforms like HubSpot and Notion, its lack of an automation engine may fall short for users looking to streamline their meeting processes.

Avoma, on the other hand, could be attractive to users seeking a more advanced tool with automation capabilities and support for multiple languages. Despite its ease of use and availability on mobile devices, its lack of in-person meeting support and local recording features may limit its appeal to those with specific meeting needs. Both tools may leave users wanting more in terms of integration depth and practical assistance in managing their meetings effectively.
