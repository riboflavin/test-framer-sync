# Fathom vs. Avoma – Which should you choose?  
AI meeting notes platforms provide four primary deliverables:  
  
* Transcripts create a word-for-word record of the meeting. For example, a one-hour product development meeting generates a searchable document containing every feature discussion, technical requirement, and team decision.  
* Action items are pulled directly from the conversation. When someone says "John will update the wireframes by Friday," the AI automatically creates a tracked task with the assignee and deadline.  
* Meeting summaries distill hour-long conversations into 2-3 paragraphs. A 45-minute sprint planning meeting becomes a concise overview of sprint goals, resource allocation, and key decisions.  
* Topic segmentation breaks discussions into labeled sections. A client call covering multiple projects is automatically divided into sections like "Website Redesign," "Q1 Marketing Campaign," and "Budget Review."  
  
In addition to the quality of these deliverables, we'll want to look at a number of other key factors:  
  
* Free trial: can you test it for free before committing?  
* Ease-of-use: does it have a simple, intuitive setup that works for non-technical users?  
* In-person meeting support: can it transcribe audio from live recordings or uploaded files, not just virtual calls?  
* Security and privacy: how is customer data handled on the platform?  
* Integrations: can it connect with your existing stack, like HubSpot, Notion, or Slack?  
* Functionality: does it go beyond transcriptions and actually help you take action?  
* Languages: can it transcribe and summarize meetings in different languages?  
* Desktop and mobile apps: can you access it on Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android for on-the-go meetings?  
* Recordings: is there support for saving and playing back audio and video recordings of meetings?    
## Evaluating Fathom and Avoma  
### Fathom
* Fathom offers accurate transcripts, quick summaries, free core features, and multi-language support, with transcripts and summaries becoming available after meetings end. The platform primarily works with Zoom, has some issues with duplicate notes during team use, and requires paid plans for advanced features like custom integrations and analytics.

### Avoma
* Avoma provides accurate transcription, AI summaries, clear speaker labeling, and integrations with CRM and calendar systems for streamlined workflows. The service requires a paid subscription starting at $59-79 per user monthly, has a learning curve for new users, and occasionally experiences delays with its meeting bot joining calls.  
## Comparison table    
Small teams and individual professionals who prioritize simplicity and multilingual support would find Fathom a natural fit, as it's free to try and requires minimal setup time. The lack of automation features and limited integration depth means users still need to handle many post-meeting tasks manually.

Larger sales teams and organizations with complex workflows would likely gravitate toward Avoma, despite its learning curve, because of its automation capabilities and CRM-focused features. However, its English-only limitation and basic integration set means teams still need other tools to fully streamline their meeting workflows.
