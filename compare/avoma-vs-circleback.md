# Avoma vs. Circleback – Which should you choose?  
AI meeting notes platforms provide four primary deliverables:  
  
* Transcripts create a word-for-word record of the meeting. For example, a one-hour product development meeting generates a searchable document containing every feature discussion, technical requirement, and team decision.  
* Action items are pulled directly from the conversation. When someone says "John will update the wireframes by Friday," the AI automatically creates a tracked task with the assignee and deadline.  
* Meeting summaries distill hour-long conversations into 2-3 paragraphs. A 45-minute sprint planning meeting becomes a concise overview of sprint goals, resource allocation, and key decisions.  
* Topic segmentation breaks discussions into labeled sections. A client call covering multiple projects is automatically divided into sections like "Website Redesign," "Q1 Marketing Campaign," and "Budget Review."  
  
In addition to the quality of these deliverables, we'll want to look at a number of other key factors:  
  
* Free trial: can you test it for free before committing?  
* Ease-of-use: does it have a simple, intuitive setup that works for non-technical users?  
* In-person meeting support: can it transcribe audio from live recordings or uploaded files, not just virtual calls?  
* Security and privacy: how is customer data handled on the platform?  
* Integrations: can it connect with your existing stack, like HubSpot, Notion, or Slack?  
* Functionality: does it go beyond transcriptions and actually help you take action?  
* Languages: can it transcribe and summarize meetings in different languages?  
* Desktop and mobile apps: can you access it on Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android for on-the-go meetings?  
* Recordings: is there support for saving and playing back audio and video recordings of meetings?    
## Evaluating Avoma and Circleback  
### Avoma
* Offers transcription with 95% accuracy, integrates with common tools like Zoom and Slack, includes a free tier, and provides administrative task automation for meetings. Platform includes extensive features beyond basic transcription, with responsive support and detailed meeting documentation capabilities.
* Platform can be complex for basic needs, occasional technical delays occur with meeting joins, and dense transcripts can be hard to scan quickly. Higher tier pricing is expensive for small teams, and speaker identification has some accuracy issues.

### Circleback
* Delivers meeting notes shortly after calls, includes key point highlighting and action item extraction, and integrates with calendar and CRM systems. Setup process is straightforward and summaries maintain high accuracy levels.
* Lacks video recording functionality and some advanced features found in more established tools. Early user base reports minimal issues, though product is still evolving with new capabilities.  
## Comparison table    
Avoma works best for teams who need a web-based solution and don't want to deal with desktop software installation and maintenance. The platform offers standard meeting features and basic integrations, though users might find themselves wanting more robust connectivity with their daily tools.

Circleback makes sense for organizations that prefer having dedicated desktop applications and local recording capabilities. While it provides similar core functionality to Avoma and includes common integrations, users may still need to handle many meeting-related tasks manually outside the platform.
