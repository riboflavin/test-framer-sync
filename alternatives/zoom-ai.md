# Alternatives to Zoom AI

Zoom AI works directly within the Zoom platform, helping make meetings more productive through automated help. It captures meeting content as it happens, creating summaries and finding action items when meetings end—all without needing extra setup or other apps.

During meetings, people can ask Zoom AI questions, like what they missed while away. The AI answers with relevant information from the ongoing discussion, helping users stay informed without disrupting the conversation or making others repeat themselves.

Beyond meetings, Zoom AI also helps with communication tasks related to meeting content. Users can use the AI to write emails and chat messages based on meeting discussions, or create documents that reflect what was covered, making post-meeting work easier within Zoom.

## Users look for alternatives to Zoom AI because...

* **Privacy concerns**: People worry about AI recording, analyzing, and potentially misusing their meeting data. For example, some organizations have banned Zoom AI Companion because they fear their confidential discussions might be used to train AI models without proper consent.

* **Technical reliability issues**: Many users report inconsistent performance, especially with transcription accuracy and meeting summaries. Some have found that AI-generated summaries sometimes miss important points or misunderstand technical terms in specialized work conversations.

* **Limited customization options**: Users often mention that Zoom AI tools can't be tailored enough for different meeting types and professional needs. For instance, a university professor noted that AI Companion couldn't be set up to focus on student participation patterns or educational outcomes, making it less helpful for teaching than for business meetings.

## How Circleback can help

People choose Circleback mainly because it works across different platforms, takes comprehensive notes, and makes sharing easy. Unlike Zoom AI, which only works in Zoom, Circleback works with multiple meeting platforms including Zoom, Google Meet, and Microsoft Teams, making it perfect for organizations that use different communication tools.

### Addressing Zoom AI's cons

Based on user feedback about Zoom AI, Circleback solves several key problems:

1. **Works on multiple platforms**: While Zoom AI only works in Zoom meetings, Circleback works across many meeting platforms, so you don't need different note-taking tools for different meetings.

2. **Better note organization**: Circleback sends notes by email and stores them in a central dashboard, making them easier to find compared to Zoom AI's meeting-bound summaries.

3. **Focus on quality notes**: Circleback specializes in note-taking, often providing more detailed and accurate summaries than Zoom AI's broader set of features.

4. **More privacy-friendly**: Unlike some AI tools, Circleback doesn't record video, only using audio for notes, which addresses many privacy concerns.

5. **Easy sharing**: Circleback's dashboard makes it simple to share meeting notes with team members who couldn't attend.
