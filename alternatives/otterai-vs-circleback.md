# Alternatives to Otter.ai

Otter.ai turns spoken conversations into written text in real time. It works during live meetings or with uploaded audio and video files, creating a searchable record of what was said. The tool identifies different speakers and captures on-screen content including slides when relevant.

Otter.ai works with popular meeting platforms like Zoom, Microsoft Teams, and Google Meet. Users can either add Otter as a meeting participant or connect their accounts to automatically record and transcribe scheduled meetings. After transcription, the text becomes available through Otter's interface where users can review, edit, and share it.

The service includes features that let users search across all their transcriptions, highlight important sections, add comments, and share transcripts with team members. Users can export transcripts in different formats and access their saved transcriptions through web browsers or mobile apps.

## Users look for alternatives to Otter.ai because...

* **Inaccurate Transcriptions** - Users often complain about Otter.ai's transcription accuracy, especially with accents, technical terms, or in noisy settings. For example, one user reported that during a medical conference, Otter transcribed "cardiovascular disease" as "car to vascular disease," making the transcript need significant editing afterward.

* **Technical Glitches** - Many users experience app crashes, syncing problems, and recording failures at key moments. One business user shared how Otter stopped recording 15 minutes into an important client meeting without any warning, resulting in lost information they couldn't recover.

* **Pricing Structure Concerns** - Users frequently criticize Otter's pricing model, noting that essential features require higher-tier subscriptions and complaining about recent price increases. A common example is how the free plan was cut from 600 minutes of transcription to only 300 minutes per month, while also limiting transcription history to just the most recent 25.
