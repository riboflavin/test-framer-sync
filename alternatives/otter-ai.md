# Alternatives to Otter.ai    
AI meeting notes platforms provide four primary deliverables:  
  
* Transcripts create a word-for-word record of the meeting. For example, a one-hour product development meeting generates a searchable document containing every feature discussion, technical requirement, and team decision.  
* Action items are pulled directly from the conversation. When someone says "John will update the wireframes by Friday," the AI automatically creates a tracked task with the assignee and deadline.  
* Meeting summaries distill hour-long conversations into 2-3 paragraphs. A 45-minute sprint planning meeting becomes a concise overview of sprint goals, resource allocation, and key decisions.  
* Topic segmentation breaks discussions into labeled sections. A client call covering multiple projects is automatically divided into sections like "Website Redesign," "Q1 Marketing Campaign," and "Budget Review."  
  
In addition to the quality of these deliverables, we'll want to look at a number of other key factors:  
  
* Free trial: can you test it for free before committing?  
* Ease-of-use: does it have a simple, intuitive setup that works for non-technical users?  
* In-person meeting support: can it transcribe audio from live recordings or uploaded files, not just virtual calls?  
* Security and privacy: how is customer data handled on the platform?  
* Integrations: can it connect with your existing stack, like HubSpot, Notion, or Slack?  
* Functionality: does it go beyond transcriptions and actually help you take action?  
* Languages: can it transcribe and summarize meetings in different languages?  
* Desktop and mobile apps: can you access it on Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android for on-the-go meetings?  
* Recordings: is there support for saving and playing back audio and video recordings of meetings?    
## Otter.ai quick pros and cons    
Otter.ai excels at making transcription accessible through its intuitive interface and generous free tier. The service shines brightest in its seamless calendar and Zoom integration, automatically capturing and transcribing meetings without friction.

The downsides are meaningful but expected for AI transcription. It struggles with accents and rapid speech, only works in English, and sometimes misidentifies speakers in conversations.

### Meeting Assistant Options

**Fathom**
Free unlimited recording and transcription with good accuracy. Works mainly with Zoom but expanding to other platforms. Multi-language support is strong.

**Fireflies**
Works across all major meeting platforms via a bot that auto-joins. $10/month/user gets you good transcription and summaries, though accuracy drops with accents.

**Granola**
Simple Mac-only app that runs locally - no meeting bot needed. $10/month flat fee, but lacks team features and is still building out core functionality.
