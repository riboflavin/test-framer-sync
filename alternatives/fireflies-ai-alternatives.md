# Alternatives to Fireflies.ai    
AI meeting notes platforms provide four primary deliverables:  
  
* Transcripts create a word-for-word record of the meeting. For example, a one-hour product development meeting generates a searchable document containing every feature discussion, technical requirement, and team decision.  
* Action items are pulled directly from the conversation. When someone says "John will update the wireframes by Friday," the AI automatically creates a tracked task with the assignee and deadline.  
* Meeting summaries distill hour-long conversations into 2-3 paragraphs. A 45-minute sprint planning meeting becomes a concise overview of sprint goals, resource allocation, and key decisions.  
* Topic segmentation breaks discussions into labeled sections. A client call covering multiple projects is automatically divided into sections like "Website Redesign," "Q1 Marketing Campaign," and "Budget Review."  
  
In addition to the quality of these deliverables, we'll want to look at a number of other key factors:  
  
* Free trial: can you test it for free before committing?  
* Ease-of-use: does it have a simple, intuitive setup that works for non-technical users?  
* In-person meeting support: can it transcribe audio from live recordings or uploaded files, not just virtual calls?  
* Security and privacy: how is customer data handled on the platform?  
* Integrations: can it connect with your existing stack, like HubSpot, Notion, or Slack?  
* Functionality: does it go beyond transcriptions and actually help you take action?  
* Languages: can it transcribe and summarize meetings in different languages?  
* Desktop and mobile apps: can you access it on Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android for on-the-go meetings?  
* Recordings: is there support for saving and playing back audio and video recordings of meetings?    
* **Pros:**
  * Wide compatibility with various platforms
  * Detailed summaries and action items provided after each meeting
* **Cons:**
  * Free plan limitations may push users to upgrade
  * Transcription accuracy around 90%, with errors for accents or jargon

- **Otter.ai**: Great for capturing meeting notes in real time with live transcription during meetings and cross-platform access. Offers strong free plan with generous transcription limits but only supports English and may have transcription errors with accents or fast speech.
- **Avoma**: Ideal for sales and customer success teams with highly accurate transcriptions, excellent AI summaries, and workflow integrations. However, it lacks a free tier, can be expensive for full features, and has a complex interface for new users.
- **Fathom**: Excels in accuracy and multi-language support, offering free unlimited usage for core features. It may have some duplicate note issues and lacks live collaboration features, mainly focusing on post-meeting output.
