# Alternatives to Fireflies.ai

Fireflies.ai is a cloud-based meeting assistant that automatically joins your virtual meetings on platforms like Zoom, Microsoft Teams, Google Meet, and Webex. It records meetings and creates transcripts with speaker labels, making everything searchable after the meeting ends.

The system pulls out key points, action items, and summaries without you having to take notes yourself. You can search through transcripts using keywords to find specific information from your discussions.

Fireflies.ai connects with workplace tools like Slack, Asana, and various CRM systems, helping teams link meeting insights with their existing workflows. The AskFred chatbot lets you ask questions about meeting content without having to read entire transcripts.

## Users look for alternatives to Fireflies.ai because...

* **Accuracy Issues**: Users often report transcription mistakes, especially with technical terms, accents, or poor audio. For example, a project manager found that during technical meetings, Fireflies consistently misheard "SQL queries" as "sequel queries," forcing them to spend time editing transcripts afterward.

* **Limited Integration Options**: While Fireflies connects with some tools, many users find these connections unreliable or too basic. A sales team reported that the Salesforce integration often failed to sync meeting notes properly, forcing them to copy information manually between platforms—defeating the purpose of automation.

* **Pricing Concerns**: Many find the pricing too expensive, particularly for larger teams, with important features only available in higher-priced plans. One startup founder had to downgrade their plan after growing from 5 to 15 team members because the per-user cost became too high, losing access to analytics tools they had come to rely on.
