# Alternatives to Avoma

Avoma works as a meeting assistant platform that joins online meetings to record, transcribe, and summarize conversations. The system processes meeting content to create organized notes broken down by discussion topics such as pain points and next steps, while also pulling out action items from the conversation.

Users can get ready for meetings with agenda templates and work together on notes in real-time during discussions. The platform also connects with customer relationship management systems like Salesforce and HubSpot, automatically sending relevant meeting information into these systems.

Many sales and customer success teams use Avoma to automatically document client calls and keep track of follow-up items, though the tool helps with general meeting productivity too. The system aims to cut down on manual note-taking while creating consistent documentation of meeting outcomes.

## Users look for alternatives to Avoma because...

* **Limited Integration Capabilities**: Many users feel frustrated with Avoma's limited connections to other tools and platforms. For example, one sales manager struggled to sync Avoma with their existing CRM system, forcing their team to manually move important customer data between platforms, which added to their workload.

* **Accuracy Issues with Transcription**: Users often mention problems with how accurately Avoma transcribes, especially for calls with background noise or multiple speakers. For instance, a customer success team found that during their weekly meetings, Avoma would mix up speakers and get technical terms wrong, requiring significant time to fix these errors afterward.

* **Steep Learning Curve**: Several reviewers say that Avoma is hard to learn, especially for team members who aren't tech-savvy. One marketing director shared that their team needed nearly a month to become comfortable with the platform, with some people still struggling to find their way around the features and use the AI insights effectively even after several weeks.
