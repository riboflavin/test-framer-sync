# Alternatives to Avoma    
AI meeting notes platforms provide four primary deliverables:  
  
* Transcripts create a word-for-word record of the meeting. For example, a one-hour product development meeting generates a searchable document containing every feature discussion, technical requirement, and team decision.  
* Action items are pulled directly from the conversation. When someone says "John will update the wireframes by Friday," the AI automatically creates a tracked task with the assignee and deadline.  
* Meeting summaries distill hour-long conversations into 2-3 paragraphs. A 45-minute sprint planning meeting becomes a concise overview of sprint goals, resource allocation, and key decisions.  
* Topic segmentation breaks discussions into labeled sections. A client call covering multiple projects is automatically divided into sections like "Website Redesign," "Q1 Marketing Campaign," and "Budget Review."  
  
In addition to the quality of these deliverables, we'll want to look at a number of other key factors:  
  
* Free trial: can you test it for free before committing?  
* Ease-of-use: does it have a simple, intuitive setup that works for non-technical users?  
* In-person meeting support: can it transcribe audio from live recordings or uploaded files, not just virtual calls?  
* Security and privacy: how is customer data handled on the platform?  
* Integrations: can it connect with your existing stack, like HubSpot, Notion, or Slack?  
* Functionality: does it go beyond transcriptions and actually help you take action?  
* Languages: can it transcribe and summarize meetings in different languages?  
* Desktop and mobile apps: can you access it on Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android for on-the-go meetings?  
* Recordings: is there support for saving and playing back audio and video recordings of meetings?    
## Avoma quick pros and cons    
Avoma excels at accurate transcription and integrates seamlessly with major business tools, making it a powerful ally for teams who need detailed meeting documentation. The platform's free tier and responsive support team make it accessible, while its automation features eliminate mundane note-taking tasks.

The platform can feel overwhelming for users seeking basic transcription services, and its premium pricing may deter smaller organizations. Technical hiccups like delayed meeting joins and occasional speaker mix-ups exist, while the detailed transcripts can sometimes be challenging to quickly scan.

## Closest Avoma competitors    
### Three Notable Meeting Tools to Consider

**Fathom** - A Zoom-first meeting assistant with a generous free tier that includes unlimited recordings. Produces instant, accurate summaries in multiple formats and lets you query past meetings. Main drawback is lack of mobile app.

**Granola** - A Mac-only tool that runs locally and captures system audio, no bot needed. Works like a simple notepad during meetings but produces enhanced AI summaries after. Limited by Mac-only support and no mobile access.

**Krisp** - Unique combo of noise cancellation and meeting notes. Removes background noise in real-time while also generating transcripts and summaries. CPU usage can be high and audio sometimes gets distorted.
