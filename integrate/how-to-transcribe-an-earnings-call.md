# How to Transcribe an Earnings Call

Transcribing earnings calls creates a permanent, searchable record of important financial information. This article explains why transcription is valuable, how to prepare for it, and various methods to create accurate transcriptsâ€”both manually and using AI tools. It also covers common challenges, best practices, and where to find existing transcripts if you don't want to create them yourself.

## Why transcribe earnings calls?

Earnings call transcripts are useful because they:

- Create a permanent record you can search and reference
- Let you analyze what executives say and how they say it
- Help team members who missed the call catch up
- Provide documentation for compliance requirements
- Make it easier to write reports or research based on the call

## Preparation before the call

Good transcription starts with homework:

Get to know the company. Learn its business model, recent results, who the key people are, and industry terms they might use.

Make sure you have what you need to record the call or access to the official recording.

Create a simple list of who will likely speak, with their names and titles. This helps you identify voices later.

Set up a document template with space for basic information like the date, company name, and who participated.

## Manual transcription process

If you're doing it yourself:

1. Record the call (with permission)
2. Take notes during the call about key moments and who's speaking
3. Transcribe in small chunks, using headphones for better clarity
4. Mark each speaker clearly:
   ```
   John Smith (CEO): Our quarterly results exceeded expectations.
   ```
5. Include important non-verbal cues in brackets:
   ```
   Jane Doe (CFO): Our expenses were [long pause] higher than anticipated.
   ```
6. Review everything carefully, especially numbers and technical terms

## Key challenges in earnings call transcription

Watch out for these common problems:

- Financial jargon and technical terms
- Multiple speakers who might sound similar
- Numbers and financial figures that must be exactly right
- People talking over each other, especially during Q&A
- Poor audio quality that makes words hard to understand

## Best practices for earnings call transcription

For the best results:

Use the same format throughout your transcript. Be consistent with how you identify speakers and organize information.

Include all the basic details at the start:
- Company name and stock ticker
- When the call happened
- Who participated from the company
- Who moderated the call

Follow the natural structure of the call:
- Operator introduction
- Legal disclaimers
- Management presentation
- Questions and answers
- Closing remarks

Double-check all numbers. A single wrong digit can change the meaning significantly.

If you can't understand something, mark it as [inaudible] rather than guessing.

## Finding and using existing transcripts

If you don't want to create transcripts yourself:

- Check the company's investor relations website
- Use financial platforms like Seeking Alpha or Quartr
- Subscribe to services like Bloomberg or FactSet
- Look for free resources on forums like Reddit

## Final steps after transcription

Once you have your transcript:

Read it through carefully. Check especially for accuracy of numbers and executive statements.

Make sure the formatting looks clean and consistent.

Add any necessary legal disclaimers about forward-looking statements.

Use tags or keywords to make the transcript easy to find later.

Store it somewhere secure where people who need it can access it easily.
