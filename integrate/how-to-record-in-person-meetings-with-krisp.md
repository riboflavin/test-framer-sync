Recording in-person meetings with Krisp: A workaround guide

## Summary
Krisp is primarily designed for virtual meetings but can be adapted for in-person recording. This article explains two methods to use Krisp for recording face-to-face meetings: the Conference Bridge Approach (creating an empty virtual meeting) and the Local Recording Enhancement (using Krisp directly without a conferencing app). It covers setup optimization, accessing recordings, and practical limitations of these workarounds.

## Understanding Krisp's recording capabilities

Krisp functions as an AI-powered meeting assistant that works with virtual conferencing platforms. Its standard functionality includes:

- Automatic recording across conferencing apps
- AI transcription with 96% accuracy
- Meeting summaries and action item generation
- Secure cloud storage for recordings
- Noise cancellation technology

The limitation is that Krisp wasn't built to capture in-person conversations directly.

## Why record in-person meetings?

Recording face-to-face meetings has several benefits:

- Creates a reference record of discussions
- Keeps absent team members informed
- Provides documentation for compliance purposes
- Frees participants from note-taking
- Enables precise tracking of commitments

## The workaround method: Using Krisp for in-person meetings

### Method 1: The conference bridge approach

1. Set up a virtual meeting room in your conferencing app
2. Configure Krisp as both microphone and speaker
3. Position your device to capture voices effectively
4. Start the meeting, joining as the only participant
5. Enable Krisp's recording feature
6. Conduct your meeting as usual

### Method 2: The local recording enhancement

1. Install Krisp on your device
2. Select both Krisp Microphone and Krisp Speaker
3. Position your device in the meeting room
4. Toggle the recording function ON
5. Begin your meeting
6. Access the recording later through your Krisp dashboard

## Optimizing your in-person recording setup

For best results:

- Test your setup beforehand
- Inform all participants about recording
- Choose rooms with minimal echo
- Position your device to capture all voices equally
- Use external microphones if needed
- Ensure sufficient battery life

## Accessing and sharing your recordings

After your meeting:

1. Find your recording on the "My Meetings" page
2. Review the transcription and recording
3. Download the recording in MP3 format if needed
4. Share access to the recording, transcript, or summary
5. Manage recipient permissions through sharing controls

Krisp provides 5GB of encrypted cloud storage for recordings.

## Practical example: A quarterly planning session

In a quarterly planning session:

1. Set up your laptop with Krisp
2. Create and join a meeting as the only participant
3. Place your laptop centrally
4. Enable recording and inform participants
5. Conduct your session normally
6. After the meeting, review the transcript and summary
7. Share key points with team members

## Limitations and considerations

These workarounds have some limitations:

- Audio quality depends on room setup
- Speaker identification may be less accurate
- Privacy considerations require informing participants
- Storage is limited to 5GB

## Conclusion

While not designed specifically for in-person meetings, Krisp can be adapted to record face-to-face conversations effectively. Using either a conferencing bridge or direct recording capability creates documentation with transcription, summaries, and sharing features.

This approach extends Krisp's capabilities to create consistent documentation across all meeting types. As work environments blend virtual and physical collaboration, these techniques help maintain comprehensive meeting records regardless of format.
