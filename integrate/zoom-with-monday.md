# Connecting Monday with Zoom using Circleback

Monday is a work management platform enabling teams to organize and track work. Users manage tasks, projects, and workflows through customizable boards where they can set deadlines, assign responsibilities, monitor progress, and communicate with team members.

The platform offers integration with third-party applications like Gmail, Slack, and Microsoft Teams. Monday includes features for time tracking, file sharing, automation of routine tasks, and data visualization through dashboards and reports.

## Why would I want to integrate Monday with Zoom?

Integrating Monday with Zoom streamlines meeting management by automatically creating and scheduling Zoom meetings directly from Monday boards. For example, when you create a new client onboarding task in Monday, the integration can automatically generate a Zoom meeting link, add it to the task, and send calendar invites to all participantsâ€”eliminating the need to switch between platforms and manually copy meeting details.

The integration improves meeting documentation by automatically logging Zoom meetings and their outcomes in your Monday workflow. After a project status call, the integration can create a new item in your Monday board containing the meeting recording, transcript, and attendance record, while allowing team members to assign action items directly from discussion points. This creates a seamless record of decisions and next steps.

Connecting Monday with Zoom enhances team accountability by linking meeting activities with project progress tracking. When a development team conducts their daily standup via Zoom, the integration can update task statuses in Monday based on what was discussed, automatically move items between workflow stages, and notify relevant stakeholders of changes. This ensures that meeting conversations translate into tracked progress and provides visibility across the organization.
