# Connecting Linear with Zoom using Circleback

Linear is project management software that enables teams to track issues, manage software development, and plan roadmaps. It offers workflow capabilities including task assignment, priority setting, task organization across projects, and progress tracking through customizable views.

The platform provides collaboration features such as commenting on tasks, notification systems, document linking, and integration with other tools like GitHub and Slack. Linear's interface allows for keyboard shortcuts, search functionality, and automatic updates across connected devices, with both web and mobile versions available.

## Why would I want to integrate Linear with Zoom?

Integrating Linear with Zoom streamlines communication between project discussions and task management. When technical issues arise during a Zoom meeting, team members can create Linear tickets directly without switching contexts. For example, if your development team identifies a critical bug during a sprint review, they can immediately create a high-priority issue in Linear without leaving the Zoom interface.

The integration enhances accountability by connecting meeting decisions to trackable tasks. Meeting action items discussed in Zoom can automatically become assigned issues in Linear with proper ownership and deadlines. When a product manager promises a feature enhancement during a client call, they can instantly create a Linear task assigned to the engineering team with the relevant context, ensuring follow-through on verbal commitments.

Linear-Zoom integration provides valuable context preservation between meetings and issue documentation. Relevant Zoom meeting recordings and transcripts can be attached to Linear issues, maintaining the original discussion's nuance. For instance, a designer can reference specific timestamp sections of a client feedback session when working on UI revisions, enabling more accurate implementation of requested changes without requiring additional clarification meetings.
