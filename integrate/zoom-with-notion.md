# Connecting Notion with Zoom using Circleback

Notion is a productivity application that combines document editing, database creation, and task management in one platform. It allows users to create pages that can contain text, images, code blocks, embedded files, and databases. Users can organize content in a hierarchical structure with nested pages.

Notion provides database functionality where users can create tables, kanban boards, calendars, and galleries to track information. The software includes templates, syncing across devices, collaboration features for sharing and commenting on documents, and API access for integrations with other tools. It operates on a freemium model with both free and paid tiers.

## Why would I want to integrate Notion with Zoom?

Integrating Notion with Zoom streamlines meeting workflows by automatically creating and organizing meeting notes. For example, when you schedule a Zoom call with your team, the integration can generate a linked Notion page with the meeting agenda, participant list, and designated space for action items—eliminating manual setup and ensuring consistent documentation for every meeting.

The integration enhances productivity by capturing meeting outcomes directly in your knowledge management system. During a client presentation via Zoom, notes taken or decisions made can automatically sync to your Notion workspace, allowing you to reference them alongside related project documents, rather than hunting through disconnected Zoom chat transcripts or hastily written notes.

Connecting these tools supports better follow-through on meeting commitments by centralizing information. After a product development Zoom call, action items captured in Notion can be immediately assigned to team members, added to project timelines, and linked to relevant resources—turning conversations into trackable work without requiring additional administrative effort.
