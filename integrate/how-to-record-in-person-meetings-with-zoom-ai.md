# Recording in-person meetings with Zoom AI – workarounds

This article explains how to use Zoom AI to record and analyze in-person meetings by starting a solo Zoom meeting on your mobile device during real-world conversations. The method provides transcripts, highlights, smart chapters, and action items from in-person discussions. The technique requires a Zoom Workplace Pro account or higher with Smart Recording enabled, and always requires consent from all participants.

## Why use Zoom AI for in-person meetings?

In-person meetings often contain critical information that's easy to miss. When a neurologist rapidly presents treatment options or a business meeting covers essential details, capturing everything accurately becomes crucial.

## The workaround method

The technique is straightforward: start a solo Zoom meeting on your phone during an in-person meeting, activate recording, and let Zoom AI generate summaries, transcripts, and insights afterward.

## What you'll need

- Zoom Workplace Pro account or higher
- Cloud recording enabled
- Audio transcript feature enabled
- Smart Recording with AI Companion enabled
- A smartphone or tablet
- Permission from all participants

## Setting up Smart Recording

1. Sign in to the Zoom web portal
2. Navigate to Settings
3. Click the AI Companion tab
4. Toggle on "Smart Recording with AI Companion"
5. Select desired features (highlights, chapters, next steps, meeting coaching)
6. Save settings

## How to record an in-person meeting

1. Ensure your device is charged with Zoom installed
2. Obtain explicit permission from all participants
3. Start a solo meeting on your device
4. Position your device centrally to capture audio clearly
5. Tap "Record" and select "Record to the Cloud"
6. Conduct your meeting normally
7. Stop recording and end the meeting when finished

## Accessing your Smart Recording

1. Sign in to Zoom web portal
2. Navigate to "Recordings & Transcripts"
3. Click on your meeting recording
4. Click the video thumbnail

## Available features

### Recording highlights
The system identifies important segments automatically. You can edit highlights, add new ones, remove existing ones, and save selected highlights as a separate clip.

### Smart chapters
The recording gets divided into logical sections with timestamps. You can edit chapter titles, split chapters, adjust timeframes, and copy the chapter overview.

### Next steps
The system identifies action items mentioned toward the meeting's end. These can be edited and shared.

### Meeting analytics
If enabled, you'll receive insights about communication patterns including talk speed, talk-listen ratio, monologue duration, and filler word usage.

## Practical applications

This approach works well for:
- Medical appointments
- Business meetings
- Educational settings
- Legal consultations
- Client meetings

## Important considerations

- Always obtain permission before recording
- Position your device for optimal audio capture
- This requires a paid Zoom account with specific features
- Be mindful of cloud storage capacity
