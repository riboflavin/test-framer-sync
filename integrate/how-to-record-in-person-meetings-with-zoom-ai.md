# Recording in-person meetings with Zoom – Workarounds

## Executive summary

This article explains how to use Zoom to record in-person meetings despite the platform being primarily designed for virtual interactions. It outlines three methods for recording face-to-face conversations: using a mobile device, laptop, or dedicated audio equipment. The article details the requirements for accessing Zoom's Smart Recording features, which provide AI-powered organization tools like automatic chapter creation, highlights, and action item extraction. Practical applications in medical, business, and educational settings are discussed, along with important legal considerations about consent and privacy.

## The in-person meeting challenge

While Zoom excels at recording virtual meetings, many important conversations still happen face-to-face. Medical appointments, business meetings with multiple stakeholders, educational discussions, and legal consultations all benefit from accurate recording. 

Consider this scenario: a man visits a neurologist alone and returns confused about treatment options the doctor had explained rapidly. This highlights a perfect use case for recording in-person conversations with organizational tools to help process complex information.

## Using Zoom's AI features for meeting recording

Zoom's Smart Recording transforms simple video captures into organized, searchable content. When enabled, it automatically divides recordings into chapters for easier navigation, creates highlights of important discussion points, generates next steps from the conversation, and provides analytics on conversation patterns. These features prove especially valuable for lengthy discussions or technical meetings where detail preservation matters.

## Setting up Zoom for in-person recording

### Method 1: Mobile device setup

Open the Zoom app on your smartphone or tablet before the meeting. Click "New Meeting" (you'll be the only participant). Position your device where it can clearly capture audio and video if desired. Tap "Record" and select "Record to the Cloud." After the meeting, end the session and wait for the cloud recording to process.

### Method 2: Laptop setup

Bring a laptop to the meeting and position it to capture participants. Launch Zoom and start a new meeting as the host. Ensure your microphone is configured to capture room audio. Click "Record" and select cloud recording. If presenting materials, share your screen to capture both conversation and visual content.

### Method 3: Dedicated audio device

For situations where video isn't necessary, connect a quality microphone to your device. Launch a meeting with just yourself, choose audio-only recording to minimize file size, and position the microphone centrally to capture all participants.

## Requirements for Zoom Smart Recording

To access Zoom's AI features, you need a licensed user account on Zoom Workplace Pro (or higher tier), cloud recording enabled, audio transcript creation enabled, and Smart Recording with AI Companion enabled. This is configured through the Zoom web portal under Settings > AI Companion.

## Practical applications

In medical appointments, you can create a new Zoom meeting on your phone before entering, position it to capture the conversation, and afterward review the AI-generated summary to ensure understanding. A patient visiting a cardiologist, for example, would receive an organized transcript with highlighted key points like medication instructions without taking frantic notes.

For in-person business discussions, set up a laptop at the conference table, use Smart Recording to automatically generate meeting minutes, and leverage the "next steps" feature to track action items.

In educational settings, position a device to record sessions, utilize smart chapters to organize different topics, and review highlights to focus on key concepts.

## Important considerations

Always inform all participants that you're recording and get their permission. Recording laws vary by location—some states require all-party consent. Be mindful of sensitive information being recorded and ensure recordings containing personal information are securely stored.

For optimal recording quality, test your setup beforehand, consider room acoustics and background noise, position microphones centrally, ensure sufficient battery life, and check available cloud storage space.

## Accessing and managing recordings

After processing, sign in to the Zoom web portal, navigate to "Recordings & Transcripts," and select the Cloud Recordings tab. From there, you can access video playback, audio transcript, smart chapters, recording highlights, and next steps. These elements can be edited for accuracy before sharing.
