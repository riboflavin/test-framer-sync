# Recording in-person meetings with Notion – Workarounds

## Summary

This article addresses the challenge of documenting in-person meetings in Notion. Most teams need a way to record conversations, generate transcripts, and integrate this information into their Notion workspaces. The article covers several approaches, from mobile recording apps like Tactiq and Fireflies to third-party services like Claap and Otter.ai. It also explains budget-friendly options using Notion AI and automation solutions through Zapier or custom API integrations. The piece concludes with best practices for recording meetings and suggestions for building a comprehensive meeting system in Notion.

## The challenge of in-person meeting documentation

For companies with many external and internal meetings, capturing discussions effectively matters a lot. As one team leader noted, "A LOT gets said, and needs following up." The challenge gets harder when different recording solutions exist in separate systems, requiring manual work to bring information back into Notion.

The ideal solution would:
- Record meeting content (audio and possibly video)
- Generate transcripts and summaries
- Automatically push this content into Notion
- Connect notes with relevant team members
- Do all this at a reasonable cost

## Mobile recording apps for in-person meetings

One straightforward approach is using mobile recording apps that later allow export to Notion.

### Tactiq Mobile

Tactiq offers a mobile app that can record in-person conversations. While known mainly for its Zoom and Google Meet features, the mobile version works well for face-to-face meetings.

**How it works:**
- Place your phone in the center of the meeting table
- Open the Tactiq app and start recording
- After the meeting, Tactiq transcribes the conversation
- Export the transcript and summary directly to Notion

For example, a product team discussing feature priorities could record their session with Tactiq, and afterward, push the transcript with automatically identified action items to their Notion project database.

### Fireflies Mobile App

Fireflies also offers a mobile solution for in-person meetings that connects with Notion.

The app records in-person conversations, creates AI-generated summaries, spots action items and key points, offers Notion export features, and can tell different speakers apart. A marketing team brainstorming campaign ideas could record their session, have Fireflies identify the approved concepts, and then push those items directly to their campaign planning database in Notion.

## Using third-party services with Notion integration

Several dedicated meeting recording services offer Notion integration, though they come at various price points.

### Claap

Claap positions itself as a comprehensive meeting capture solution with Notion integration capabilities.

**Workflow example:**
- Use Claap's standalone recording option for in-person meetings
- Claap transcribes and summarizes the meeting content
- Through its Notion integration, meeting notes are automatically pushed to your workspace
- Team members can be tagged in the Notion entry

A sales team could record customer feedback sessions, and Claap would automatically organize the insights and action items into their Notion CRM setup.

### Otter.ai

Otter is another popular transcription service that can be used for in-person meetings with Notion export.

The process is simple: record meetings using the Otter mobile app, let Otter generate the transcript with speaker identification, then export the content to Notion manually or through automation tools. A project management team could record their weekly stand-ups with Otter, then have the action items automatically transferred to their Notion project tracker.

## Automation solutions for seamless integration

For teams looking to minimize manual work, automation tools can create a more seamless connection between recording tools and Notion.

### Using Zapier or Make (formerly Integromat)

These automation platforms can connect various recording services with Notion, even when native integrations aren't available.

**Sample automation:**
- Record meeting with a service like Otter.ai or Temi
- When a new transcript is completed, trigger an automation
- Extract key information (participants, action items, decisions)
- Create a new entry in your Notion meeting database
- Tag relevant team members

### API solutions

For companies with technical resources, custom API integrations can create tailored solutions.

As one user suggested: "If whatever solution you are using has an API, you can ask someone to make [an integration] yourselves." This approach offers the most customization, though it requires development resources.

## Budget-friendly approaches

Cost matters, especially for small teams. As one user mentioned, "adding a meeting recorder that costs over double the amount of Notion is never going to be signed off."

### Two-step manual process

For teams on a tight budget, a simple two-step process works well: use a free or low-cost recording app (like Voice Recorder on smartphones), then use Notion AI to transcribe and summarize the recording, and manually organize the content in your Notion workspace. While this needs more manual effort, it avoids subscription fees for dedicated services.

### Voice Notes + Notion AI

Notion AI can process audio files, making this another cost-effective approach.

The steps are straightforward: record meetings using your phone's voice recorder, upload the audio file to Notion, use Notion AI to generate a transcript and summary, and organize the content in your meeting database. A small startup team could document their weekly strategy sessions this way without extra software costs.

## Best practices for in-person meeting recordings

Regardless of which technical solution you pick, follow these best practices:

- **Get consent**: Always tell participants that you're recording the meeting
- **Improve audio quality**: Put the recording device in the center of the table
- **Identify speakers**: Start with introductions so voice recognition works better
- **Structure your Notion database**: Create a template for meeting notes with fields for date, participants, decisions, and action items
- **Follow-up process**: Establish a review workflow to ensure action items are assigned
