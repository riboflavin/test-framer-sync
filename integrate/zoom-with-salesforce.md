# Connecting Salesforce with Zoom using Circleback

Salesforce is a cloud-based customer relationship management (CRM) platform that helps businesses track sales, service, marketing, and commerce activities. The system centralizes customer information, including contact details, interaction history, and purchase records, allowing teams to access and update data from different devices and locations.

The platform includes modules for sales management, customer service, marketing automation, e-commerce, and analytics. Salesforce can be customized with additional applications through its AppExchange marketplace and integrated with other business systems. The company offers different subscription tiers with varying features based on business size and needs.

## Why would I want to integrate Salesforce with Zoom?

Integrating Salesforce with Zoom enables seamless meeting management directly within your CRM workflow, eliminating the need to switch between platforms. For example, sales representatives can schedule, launch, and document Zoom calls with prospects directly from contact records in Salesforce, maintaining a comprehensive view of all customer interactions in one place while saving valuable time previously spent on manual data entry.

The integration creates automated documentation of customer conversations by recording Zoom meetings and linking them to relevant Salesforce records. When a sales team conducts a product demo via Zoom, the recording, attendee information, and meeting duration are automatically captured in the prospect's Salesforce record, ensuring critical details aren't lost and enabling team members to quickly reference past discussions without requesting summaries from colleagues.

Finally, connecting these platforms enhances data-driven decision making by incorporating video engagement metrics into your sales analytics. Sales managers can track which prospects engage most actively in video meetings, analyze how meeting frequency correlates with deal progression, and identify the most effective communication approaches across the sales cycle. For instance, discovering that deals with three or more Zoom touchpoints close 40% faster allows teams to adjust their engagement strategies for better outcomes.
