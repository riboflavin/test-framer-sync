How to record an all-hands call

## Summary

This guide explains how to record all-hands meetings effectively. It covers why recording matters, necessary preparation steps, tool selection, recording process, and best practices. Recording all-hands calls creates a reference for absent team members, documents important decisions, helps new hires, and allows participants to focus on the meeting rather than note-taking. The article provides practical advice for before, during, and after recording to ensure your all-hands recordings are useful and accessible.

## Why recording all-hands calls is important

Recording company-wide meetings matters for simple reasons:

* Creates a record for people who couldn't attend
* Lets everyone review important announcements later
* Documents company milestones and strategic decisions
* Helps new people understand recent company history
* Ensures everyone gets the same message

When people don't have to frantically take notes, they can actually pay attention to what's being said. The recording becomes the shared truth, not scattered interpretations.

## Preparation before recording

Good recordings don't happen by accident. You need to prepare.

Tell everyone the call will be recorded. This isn't just polite - in some places it's required by law. Put this info right in the meeting invite.

Test your setup before the actual meeting. Nothing worse than discovering your mic was muted for the whole call.

Make an agenda document. Structure helps the meeting flow and makes the recording more useful. Think of it as an outline for a talk.

Assign clear roles - someone to handle recording, someone to moderate, maybe someone to take backup notes. When everyone knows their job, things run smoother.

## Choosing the right recording tool

Your options fall into a few categories:

* Built-in tools: Zoom, Teams, and Meet all have recording features
* Standalone software: OBS Studio or Camtasia for more control
* AI tools: Services that record and generate notes automatically
* Mobile apps: Voice recorders for simple audio capture

For most distributed teams, using your video call software plus an AI note-taking tool works best. Don't make this complicated - pick tools that fade into the background.

## Step-by-step process to record an all-hands call

### 1. Setting up the recording

For video calls:
* Start the meeting as host
* Click "Record"
* Choose where to save it
* Announce that recording has started

For in-person meetings:
* Position equipment to capture speakers and visuals
* Check sound levels
* Use backup devices when possible

### 2. During the meeting

While recording runs, keep these points in mind:

People should say who they are before speaking. This helps listeners of the recording know who's talking.

Ask presenters to describe what they're showing on screen. "As you can see in this graph" means nothing in an audio recording.

Repeat questions before answering them. The person asking might not be near a mic.

For longer meetings, build in breaks. This creates natural segments in the recording.

## Post-meeting processing

Once you finish:

* Stop recording
* Name the file clearly (All-Hands-2023-07-15-Q2-Results)
* Set appropriate access permissions
* Consider adding timestamps to help navigation

## Distribution and accessibility

Getting the recording to your team matters as much as making it:

* Put it somewhere everyone can access
* Send the link to the whole team
* Include a brief summary of key points
* Add timestamps for longer recordings

The best recording is useless if people can't find it when they need it.

## Enhancing all-hands call recordings

* Add timestamps so people can jump to what they need
* Write a summary of main points and decisions
* Get a transcript made to make content searchable
* Include any slides or documents mentioned

These extras don't take much time but make recordings much more useful.

## Making all-hands calls more engaging

Recording doesn't mean boring. Good all-hands calls include:

* Demos and visual elements
* Interactive parts like polls or Q&A
* Different speakers with various perspectives
* Short, focused mini-talks on specific topics

A dynamic meeting creates a recording people will actually want to watch.

## Best practices for recording all-hands calls

Sound quality matters most. Bad audio makes even the best content worthless.

Be careful with sensitive information. Think about what shouldn't be recorded.

Organize recordings logically so people can find past meetings.

Share recording responsibilities among team members.

Ask for feedback on how to make recordings more useful.

## Overcoming common challenges

Always have a backup recording method. Technology fails at the worst times.

For virtual meetings, use interactive elements to keep people engaged.

Break long recordings into logical segments with clear markers.

Establish a clear signal for when to pause recording during sensitive discussions.

The best recordings are those no one has to think about - they just work when needed.
