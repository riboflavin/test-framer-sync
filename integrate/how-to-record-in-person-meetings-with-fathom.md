# Recording in-person meetings with Fathom – workarounds

This article describes how to adapt Fathom, a tool designed for virtual meetings, to record in-person meetings. It outlines three main methods: using a solo Zoom session on a laptop, setting up a dedicated recording station with quality microphones, or using multiple devices for complex settings. The guide also covers audio optimization techniques, utilizing Fathom's features effectively, and important limitations to consider.

## Why use Fathom for in-person meetings?

Fathom creates AI summaries within 30 seconds after meetings end. The typical user saves about 20 minutes per meeting - equivalent to 1.5 weeks annually. The tool offers search capabilities and clip sharing across 28 languages. Users can also interact with recordings through an AI assistant for quick information retrieval.

## Setting up a virtual bridge for in-person meetings

The core strategy involves creating a "virtual bridge" that Fathom can connect to:

### Method 1: The solo Zoom approach

This works well for smaller meetings:

1. Create a Zoom meeting on your laptop and enable Fathom
2. Position your laptop to capture all participants
3. Use your laptop's microphone or connect an external one
4. Start the meeting

A team of five could set a laptop at one end of the table with the camera facing everyone. Fathom records as if it were a regular virtual meeting.

### Method 2: The dedicated recording station

For larger meetings or better audio quality:

1. Set up a dedicated device running a video conferencing platform
2. Connect a quality omnidirectional or conference microphone
3. Position for optimal video capture
4. Start a meeting with just this device and enable Fathom

### Method 3: The multiple angle approach

For larger rooms or complex presentations:

1. Start a video conference with multiple devices positioned around the room
2. Have each device join the same virtual meeting
3. Designate one primary device with Fathom enabled
4. Mute all secondary devices to prevent audio feedback

## Optimizing audio quality

Audio quality determines transcription accuracy:

- Use a dedicated conference microphone when possible
- Position microphones centrally among speakers
- For large rooms, consider using multiple microphones
- Test your setup before the actual meeting
- Ask participants to speak clearly

## Making the most of Fathom's features

Once your virtual bridge is set up, you can use all of Fathom's features:

### Real-time highlighting
- Mark important moments during the meeting
- Flag action items as they emerge
- Highlight key decisions for later reference

### Post-meeting organization
- Review the AI-generated summary
- Search through the transcript for specific topics
- Share important clips with team members
- Extract action items for follow-up

### CRM integration
- Sync meeting notes automatically to your CRM
- Attach meeting summaries to customer records
- Share relevant portions with colleagues

## Limitations and considerations

These methods have limitations:

- Video quality may not capture everyone equally well
- Audio clarity depends on room acoustics and microphone quality
- Speaker distinction may be less accurate than in online meetings
- Battery life could be an issue for longer meetings
- Privacy considerations must be addressed

Always inform participants that the meeting is being recorded and obtain consent where required.

## Final tips for success

To ensure best results:

1. Do a test run before important meetings
2. Check lighting conditions for good video quality
3. Consider room acoustics when selecting a meeting space
4. Position your recording device where it won't be obstructed
5. Have a backup power source for longer meetings
6. Explain to participants why you're recording
