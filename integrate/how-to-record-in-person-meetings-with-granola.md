# Recording in-person meetings with Granola: A practical guide

## Summary
Granola primarily serves virtual meetings and faces a key limitation with in-person meetings: all participants register as a single speaker since everyone's voice enters through one microphone. Despite this constraint, you can still produce valuable meeting records by optimizing your setup, using strategic techniques, and employing the iPhone app which offers better speaker identification. This guide covers practical workarounds and methods to maximize Granola's utility for face-to-face discussions.

## Understanding Granola's in-person meeting limitations

Granola works by using your device's system audio and microphone to differentiate between speakers. In an in-person meeting, this creates a fundamental limitation: the app registers all participants as a single speaker since everyone's voice comes through your microphone rather than as separate audio streams.

Despite this limitation, Granola can still produce valuable meeting notes with some adjustments to your approach.

## Optimizing your setup for in-person recording

To maximize Granola's effectiveness during in-person meetings:

### Device positioning
Place your device centrally on the meeting table where it can clearly capture everyone's voices. For larger meetings, position it closer to quiet speakers or move it as needed when different people are speaking.

### Microphone quality
Your device's microphone quality directly affects transcription accuracy. For large meeting rooms, an external microphone with wider pickup range can dramatically improve audio capture.

### Room acoustics
Choose quieter meeting locations when possible. Close windows to reduce outdoor noise. In rooms with hard surfaces that create echoes, position yourself and your device to maximize clarity.

## Using Granola for in-person meetings: Step-by-step

1. **Create a meeting entry**
   Ensure meetings are in your calendar with attendee information, or create a new note manually for impromptu meetings.

2. **Open Granola before starting**
   Launch Granola and open the appropriate meeting note a few minutes early.

3. **Start transcription manually**
   For calendar events, transcription begins at the scheduled start time. For impromptu meetings, it begins when you open the notes.

4. **Check your transcription**
   Periodically check the live transcript by clicking the "dancing bars" icon to confirm audio capture.

5. **Use name attribution during the meeting**
   Instead of asking "What do you think?", say "Sarah, what do you think about this approach?"

6. **Take strategic notes**
   Add contextual notes to highlight key points, decisions, or action items.

7. **Query during the meeting as needed**
   Use the Cmd+J shortcut to review earlier statements or catch up on missed points.

## iPhone option for better results

The iPhone app offers enhanced speaker identification for in-person meetings:

1. Place your iPhone in the center of the meeting table
2. Ensure it remains unlocked during the meeting
3. Keep the app in the foreground

## Working around speaker identification issues

Employ these strategies to enhance transcript clarity:

### Manual speaker notation
Annotate who is speaking during key moments: "[Marketing Director]: We need to increase our Q4 budget by 15%."

### Post-meeting clarification
After the meeting, review the transcript and add speaker identifications.

### Use meeting structure
Note which topics were addressed by which speakers in your meeting notes.

### Name-based follow-ups
Be explicit: "John will deliver the market research by Friday" rather than "You'll get that to us by Friday."

## Maximizing Granola's AI enhancement

To improve AI-generated documentation:

### Add context in your notes
Include background information and participant relationships.

### Clarify ambiguities immediately
Add clarifying notes right away rather than trying to decipher the transcript later.

### Use templates
Leverage customizable templates for consistent note format regardless of the meeting environment.

## Example scenario: Product team weekly sync

For a product team's in-person sync:

1. Create a calendar event with all attendees listed
2. Position your device centrally
3. Start with: "Weekly Product Sync with Alex, Priya, Devon, and Jordan"
4. Prompt speakers by name: "Priya, can you update us on the user testing results?"
5. Manually add speaker attributions for critical decisions
6. Verbally summarize key points: "So to recap what Jordan just shared..."

## Conclusion

While Granola wasn't built to distinguish between multiple speakers in-person, these workarounds can help you capture valuable information and produce useful enhanced notes. The iPhone app offers improved performance, so consider that option for important face-to-face discussions.

Transcription quality depends heavily on audio clarity, so optimize your meeting environment and device positioning. By combining Granola's AI capabilities with strategic note-taking practices, you can create comprehensive documentation of your in-person discussions despite the current limitations.
