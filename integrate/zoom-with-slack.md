# Connecting Slack with Zoom using Circleback

Slack is a messaging platform for teams and workplaces that organizes conversations into channels. Users can send direct messages, share files, make voice and video calls, and integrate with third-party applications. The platform offers search functionality to find past conversations and documents.

Slack works across desktop, mobile, and web browsers, allowing teams to communicate regardless of location. It provides notification settings, thread capabilities for organizing discussions, and customization options including status updates and profile settings. Teams can create both public and private channels to segment conversations by project, topic, or department.

## Why would I want to integrate Slack with Zoom?

Integrating Slack with Zoom streamlines communication by enabling teams to start video conferences directly from Slack channels or direct messages. Instead of switching between applications and sharing meeting links manually, team members can use simple slash commands like "/zoom" to instantly create and share meeting links within conversations. This reduces friction when transitioning from text-based discussions to face-to-face interactions, particularly valuable when a complex topic arises in a Slack thread that requires immediate verbal clarification.

The integration enhances productivity by centralizing meeting notifications and reminders within your team's primary communication hub. When Zoom meetings are scheduled, automatic notifications can appear in relevant Slack channels, including meeting agendas and one-click join options. For example, a marketing team can receive automated reminders in their #marketing-team channel before their weekly strategy meetings, ensuring everyone joins promptly with the necessary context and materials.

Combining these platforms also creates a more complete documentation system, as meeting recordings and transcripts can be automatically shared in Slack after Zoom calls conclude. When a product design review happens in Zoom, the recording can automatically post to the #product-development channel, allowing team members who couldn't attend to catch up and preserving important decisions for future reference. This seamless information flow ensures that valuable discussions aren't lost and remain accessible within the team's communication history.
