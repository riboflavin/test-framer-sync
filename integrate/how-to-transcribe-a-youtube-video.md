How to transcribe a YouTube video

## Summary

This article explains how to convert spoken content from YouTube videos into written text. It covers five main methods: using YouTube's built-in transcript feature, third-party websites, AI tools, ChatGPT for cleanup, and command-line tools. The article also discusses practical applications, tips for better results, and privacy considerations. Transcription helps with accessibility, content repurposing, and creating searchable records of information.

## Why transcribe YouTube videos

People transcribe YouTube videos for several good reasons:

- Making videos accessible to deaf or hard-of-hearing viewers
- Creating text you can search through later
- Helping non-native speakers understand content
- Turning video content into blog posts or social media content
- Making study materials from lectures or tutorials
- Capturing information from interviews or talks

## Method 1: YouTube's built-in transcript feature

YouTube already has transcripts for many videos. Here's how to get them:

1. Open the YouTube video
2. Click the three dots (â‹®) below the video
3. Select "Open transcript"
4. Copy the text that appears

If you want to remove the timestamps:

1. Copy all the text
2. Paste into a text editor
3. Delete the timestamps manually or use search/replace

This is the simplest method but might need some cleanup work.

## Method 2: Third-party websites

Several websites can extract YouTube transcripts more cleanly than copying from YouTube directly:

- **youtube-transcript.io**: Gets transcripts with or without timestamps
- **ytb2mp4.com/youtube-transcript**: Simple interface for quick transcript access
- **tubetotext.com**: Lets you toggle timestamps on or off

Using these sites is straightforward:

1. Copy the YouTube video URL
2. Paste it into the website
3. Click the extract button
4. Copy your transcript

## Method 3: AI-powered tools

Modern AI tools can create accurate transcripts and offer extra features:

### Mobile Apps
- **EchoNotes**: Extracts and summarizes transcripts
- **VOMO AI**: Works with over 50 languages and lets you chat with the transcript

### Desktop Tools
- **Otter.ai**: Popular for general transcription
- **Circleback.ai**: Transcribes videos and adds summaries and action items
- **Eddy by Headliner**: Offers free transcription (with limits)

Using Circleback for YouTube transcription:

1. Create an account
2. Import the YouTube audio/video
3. Let the AI transcribe it
4. Review the transcript and AI insights

## Method 4: Using ChatGPT for cleanup

If your transcript has timestamps and messy formatting, ChatGPT can help:

1. Give ChatGPT this prompt: "I will give you a copy and paste of a youtube transcript. This includes timestamps, and the text is disjointed. Please remove the timestamps and rewrite the text into joined-up prose. Do not start writing yet. Do you understand?"
2. After it says yes, paste your messy transcript
3. Get back clean, readable text

## Method 5: Command-line tools

For people comfortable with technical tools:

- **YouTube-dl**: Downloads subtitles directly
- **Subtitle Edit**: Converts subtitles to plain text

This approach gives you the most control but needs technical know-how.

## Tips for better transcriptions

No matter which method you choose:

- Check for mistakes, especially with technical terms or accents
- Videos with clear audio produce better transcripts
- Some tools work better with certain languages
- Save transcripts in an organized way

## Example use case

Imagine you're researching a competitor's product launch:

1. Get the YouTube transcript
2. Clean it up in a text editor or with ChatGPT
3. Review it for key information
4. Create a summary with the main points

This saves you from rewatching a long video multiple times.

## Privacy considerations

When using transcription services:

- Read privacy policies before using tools
- Be careful with confidential information
- Consider tools that process data locally when privacy matters

Tools like Circleback can help you not just get the transcript, but understand what matters in the content through summaries and key points, saving you both transcription time and analysis time.
