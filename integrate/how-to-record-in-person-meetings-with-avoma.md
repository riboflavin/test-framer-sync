Recording in-person meetings with Avoma: Workaround methods

## Summary
Avoma is designed for digital meetings but can be adapted for in-person recording using two main workarounds: running a parallel conference call during your in-person meeting, or recording the meeting separately and uploading it afterward. Both methods have limitations around speaker identification and audio quality but can effectively capture meeting content for transcription and analysis.

## Understanding Avoma's in-person meeting limitations

Avoma primarily works with video conferencing software and phone dialers, not in-person meetings. Its core functionality targets digital communication where speaker identification is straightforward. You can still use Avoma for in-person meetings through alternative approaches.

## Method 1: Setting up a conference call during in-person meetings

The simplest workaround is running a conference call alongside your in-person meeting.

**Implementation steps:**

1. Schedule a meeting via your regular conferencing tool
2. Configure Avoma to record this meeting
3. Keep the call active on a device with a microphone during your in-person meeting
4. Position the device centrally to maximize audio capture

**Limitations:**

- Speaker identification will be minimal - Avoma typically recognizes only the call host
- Audio quality depends on microphone placement and room acoustics
- Participants far from the device may not be clearly recorded

**Example scenario:** 
A team places a laptop running a Zoom call in the center of their conference table. The resulting transcript will show most dialogue attributed to "Host" rather than specific individuals.

## Method 2: Upload recordings after the meeting

This approach lets you focus entirely on your meeting without managing a parallel call.

**Steps:**

1. Record your meeting using dedicated audio equipment
2. Save the recording in an Avoma-supported format (mp4, avi, mkv, mp3, wav)
3. Upload the recording to Avoma after the meeting
4. Process to generate transcription and AI notes

**Considerations:**

- Requires separate recording equipment setup
- Recording isn't immediately available in Avoma
- Speaker identification remains challenging

**Example scenario:**
A product manager records a focus group with a quality omnidirectional microphone, then uploads the file to Avoma for transcription and analysis of key feedback points.

## Optimizing your in-person recording quality

**Audio Environment Considerations:**
- Use quiet locations with minimal background noise
- Close windows and doors to reduce environmental sounds
- Turn off noisy equipment when possible
- Ask participants to speak clearly

**Microphone Placement Strategies:**
- Position recording devices centrally
- For larger groups, use multiple strategically placed devices
- Test audio quality before starting
- Manage speaking volumes based on proximity to microphones

**Enhancing Speaker Identification:**
- Have facilitators verbally identify speakers
- Ask participants to state their names before speaking
- Manually edit speaker names in the transcript later

## Creating a hybrid approach for optimal results

For meetings with both in-person and remote participants:

1. Set up proper video conferencing equipment in your meeting room
2. Gather in-person attendees around a quality microphone
3. Connect remote participants via your standard platform
4. Record the session with Avoma as you would a virtual meeting

This captures remote participants clearly while also recording in-room discussion.

## Compliance and consent considerations

When recording meetings:

- Inform all participants that recording is happening
- Obtain appropriate consent per your jurisdiction
- Consider displaying a visible recording notice
- Follow organizational recording policies

## Conclusion

While Avoma lacks native in-person meeting support, these workarounds let you use its transcription and AI note-taking for face-to-face interactions. Each method has tradeoffs, so choose based on your specific needs.

For teams frequently recording in-person meetings, investing in quality audio equipment substantially improves results. With these adaptations, you can extend Avoma beyond virtual meetings to document your in-person discussions effectively.
