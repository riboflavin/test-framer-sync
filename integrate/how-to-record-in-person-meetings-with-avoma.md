# Recording in-person meetings with Avoma – Workarounds

Avoma was built primarily for virtual meetings, but with some workarounds, you can use it for in-person discussions too. The platform integrates with video conferencing tools like Zoom and phone systems, but doesn't directly support face-to-face meetings. This doesn't mean you can't capture your in-person conversations—you just need to bridge the physical and digital worlds.

## Understanding Avoma's in-person meeting limitations

Avoma doesn't offer direct, native support for in-person meetings. The platform is mainly designed to integrate with:

- Video conferencing platforms (Zoom, Microsoft Teams, Google Meet)
- Phone dialers (Outreach, RingCentral, Aircall)

However, you can still use Avoma's features for your in-person conversations with some creative approaches.

## Workaround #1: Virtual bridge method

The most straightforward approach to recording in-person meetings with Avoma is to create a virtual bridge between your physical room and Avoma's digital capabilities.

### How to implement:

1. **Create a virtual meeting room**: Schedule a standard Zoom, Teams, or Google Meet call that coincides with your in-person meeting.

2. **Set up appropriate audio equipment**: Place a laptop or conference room system in the center of your meeting area, making sure the microphone can pick up voices from around the table.

3. **Join the virtual meeting**: Have the host join the call and enable Avoma to record it as normal.

4. **Conduct your in-person meeting**: Proceed with your face-to-face discussion while the virtual meeting runs in the background.

### Example scenario:

Sarah, a product manager, needs to conduct a crucial in-person brainstorming session with her design team. She creates a Zoom meeting scheduled for the same time, places her laptop in the center of the conference table, connects a good microphone, joins the Zoom meeting with Avoma enabled, and conducts her brainstorming session.

Afterward, Sarah gets Avoma's AI-generated notes and full transcript, capturing the key points discussed by her team.

### Limitations to be aware of:

When using this method, you'll likely face two main challenges:

1. **Speaker identification limitation**: Since only one microphone captures all voices, Avoma will recognize only one speaker (the host). This means the transcript won't distinguish between different team members speaking.

2. **Uneven audio quality**: People sitting further from the microphone may not be captured clearly, affecting transcription accuracy.

## Workaround #2: Post-meeting upload method

If you prefer to focus entirely on your in-person meeting without managing a virtual call at the same time, you can record the meeting independently and upload it to Avoma afterward.

### How to implement:

1. **Record your meeting**: Use a dedicated recording device, smartphone app, or conference room system to capture high-quality audio.

2. **Save in compatible format**: Make sure your recording is saved in one of Avoma's supported formats: MP4, AVI, MKV, MP3, or WAV.

3. **Upload to Avoma**: After the meeting, log into Avoma and use the "Upload a Meeting Recording" function to process your file.

4. **Review and edit**: Once processed, review the transcript and AI-generated notes, making any necessary edits.

### Example scenario:

Marcus, a sales director, conducts weekly in-person deal review meetings with his regional managers. He uses a professional audio recorder on the conference table, records the entire meeting, and after it's done, uploads the file to Avoma. He then receives a full transcript and AI notes within minutes.

### Advantages of this approach:

- No need to manage a virtual meeting during your in-person discussion
- Potential for better audio quality with dedicated recording equipment
- More natural conversation flow without the presence of a laptop/screen

The same speaker identification limitations apply, but with high-quality recording equipment, the audio clarity can be significantly better.

## Optimizing audio quality for better results

Regardless of which method you choose, audio quality dramatically impacts Avoma's ability to generate accurate transcripts. Here are strategies to maximize audio clarity:

### Equipment recommendations:

- **Omnidirectional microphones**: Consider getting a quality omnidirectional conference microphone that can capture voices from around a table.

- **Smart positioning**: Place your recording device/microphone in the center, ideally at equal distance from all participants.

- **Test before important meetings**: Run a brief test recording before critical sessions to verify audio quality.

### Environment considerations:

- **Room acoustics**: Choose meeting spaces with minimal echo and background noise.

- **Participant awareness**: Ask participants to speak clearly and avoid talking over each other.

- **Speaker proximity**: When possible, ask participants to sit closer to the microphone.

## Enhancing speaker identification

While Avoma can't automatically distinguish between different in-person speakers, you can take steps to improve this after the fact:

1. **Manual speaker editing**: After uploading your recording, use Avoma's speaker editing feature to manually identify different participants in the transcript.

2. **Speaker notation during meetings**: Have participants briefly state their name before speaking, which makes post-meeting speaker identification much easier.

3. **Designated spokespersons**: For larger meetings, consider having information flow through designated team spokespersons to reduce the number of different speakers.

## Legal and ethical considerations

Before recording any in-person meeting, it's essential to address privacy and consent concerns:

1. **Explicit consent**: Always inform all participants that the meeting is being recorded and get their consent. In some places, this is legally required.

2. **Meeting agenda notation**: Include a note about recording in meeting invites and agendas.

3. **Visual indicators**: Consider placing a "Meeting Being Recorded" sign in the room as a reminder.

4. **Data protection**: Make sure recorded content is stored securely and follows your organization's data protection policies.
