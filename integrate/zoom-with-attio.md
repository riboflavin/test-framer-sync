# Connecting Attio with Zoom using Circleback

Attio is a customer relationship management (CRM) platform that allows users to organize contact data. It provides a database system for tracking interactions with customers, prospects, and partners while enabling teams to create custom workflows for sales pipelines, investor relations, and business development processes.

The platform features data synchronization with email and calendar services, customizable views for different team needs, and automation capabilities to reduce manual data entry. Attio includes collaboration tools for teams to share information and maintains contact records that update in real-time as new interactions occur.

## Why would I want to integrate Attio with Zoom?

Integrating Attio with Zoom creates a seamless workflow between your CRM and video communications. When a sales rep hosts a discovery call with a prospect, the integration can automatically log that meeting in Attio, including duration, participants, and even recording links. This eliminates manual data entry and ensures all customer touchpoints are properly documented in your relationship management system.

The integration enables better meeting preparation and follow-up by giving teams contextual information at critical moments. Before joining a Zoom call, reps can review relevant Attio contact details, previous interactions, and deal stage information. After the call, they can quickly update opportunity status or add action items directly from the meeting interface, such as when a prospect expresses budget concerns that need addressing in a future proposal.

Analytics across both platforms provide valuable insights for improving sales and customer success processes. By connecting Zoom meeting frequency and duration with Attio deal progression data, organizations can identify patterns like "deals with at least three Zoom meetings in the first month close 40% more frequently." Teams can also track which types of video interactions (demos, training sessions, quarterly reviews) correlate with higher customer retention or expansion rates as tracked in Attio.
