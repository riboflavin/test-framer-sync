# Connecting Hubspot with Zoom using Circleback

HubSpot is a customer relationship management (CRM) platform that offers software for marketing, sales, customer service, and content management. The platform combines database functions with email marketing, social media management, web analytics, and lead tracking capabilities. Users can manage contacts, track interactions, create landing pages, and automate workflows.

The software operates on a tiered pricing model with free and paid versions offering different functionality levels. HubSpot integrates with many third-party applications including Gmail, Outlook, Slack, and various social media platforms. The platform provides reporting tools to monitor performance metrics and includes a mobile application for accessing data remotely.

## Why would I want to integrate Hubspot with Zoom?

Integrating HubSpot with Zoom streamlines your meeting workflow by automatically syncing meeting data across platforms. When a prospect books a demo through HubSpot, the integration creates a Zoom meeting, adds it to both parties' calendars, and logs the details in your CRM. This eliminates manual data entry and reduces scheduling errors, ensuring your sales team can focus on selling rather than administrative tasks.

The integration enhances lead nurturing by capturing valuable engagement data from Zoom meetings directly in HubSpot contact records. For example, when a prospect attends your webinar, their attendance status, engagement score, and questions asked can be automatically logged in HubSpot. This provides your marketing and sales teams with deeper insights into prospect interest levels, enabling more personalized follow-up communications.

Finally, combining these platforms improves analytics capabilities by connecting meeting activities with sales outcomes. For instance, you can track which types of Zoom meetings (product demos, consultations, webinars) most effectively move prospects through your sales pipeline. This data helps optimize your sales process by identifying which meeting formats drive the highest conversion rates, allowing you to allocate resources more effectively toward high-performing engagement strategies.
