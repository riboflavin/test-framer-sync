## Summary

This article explains why and how to record earnings calls for later analysis. Recording calls lets you review complex financial information, create accurate notes, extract executive quotes, share insights with teammates, and build historical performance archives. The article covers different recording methods, including using specialized tools like Circleback, as well as how to maximize value from these recordings through AI analysis, searching call content, and organizing a library of earnings calls over time.

## Why record earnings calls?

Earnings calls contain critical information that affects investment decisions and market understanding. Recording them lets you:

- Review complex financial details multiple times
- Create accurate notes and summaries
- Pull specific quotes from executives
- Share insights with team members who missed the call
- Build a history of performance data over time

## Methods for recording earnings calls

### Using Circleback's desktop app

Circleback offers a simple way to record, transcribe, and summarize earnings calls:

1. Download the desktop app from circleback.ai/desktop
2. Open the app and log in
3. Select "New meeting → Record" 
4. Choose your recording settings
5. Click record when the call starts
6. Select "Done" when the call ends

You can also set up automatic recordings:

1. Go to Settings → Calendar → Desktop recording
2. Turn on automatic start/stop recordings
3. The app will record based on your calendar events

This works well for scheduled calls that appear on your calendar.

### Recording phone-based earnings calls on iPhone

For calls that happen over the phone:

1. Make sure your iPhone runs iOS 18.1 or newer
2. During the call, select the record option
3. Find the recording in your Notes app after the call
4. Open it, tap "...", and select "Save Audio to Files"
5. Save to "On My Phone"
6. Visit app.circleback.ai in Safari
7. Select New → Import
8. Pick your saved recording
9. Import the file for processing

## Getting the most value from recorded calls

Recording is just the start. Here's how to get more value:

### Automated analysis with AI

Tools like Circleback can:

- Turn the whole call into a text transcript
- Find key financial figures mentioned
- Pull out forward-looking statements
- Create a summary of main points
- Generate action items based on what was discussed

If an executive mentions a 15% revenue increase projection, the software can highlight this as a key insight.

### Reviewing and searching call content

After processing your recording, you can:

1. Read the full transcript organized by speaker
2. Search for specific terms like "revenue" or "expansion"
3. Jump to key moments in the recording
4. Ask follow-up questions through the meeting assistant

For example, if you need to find what the CFO said about supply chain issues, you can search for that term without replaying the whole call.

### Sharing insights with your team

Good tools make it easy to share what you learn:

- Send notes to team members by email
- Share specific insights to Slack
- Update CRM systems with relevant information
- Create tasks in project management tools

A financial analyst might set up a system to update their team's database with quarterly figures extracted from each call.

## Important considerations when recording earnings calls

### Legal and ethical considerations

While earnings calls are public information, you should:

- Use recordings for personal or internal business use only
- Don't redistribute recordings without permission
- Remember that forward-looking statements have risks
- Understand that actual results may differ from projections

### Technical requirements

For good recording quality:

- Use a stable internet connection
- Have a decent computer with enough power
- Make sure you have enough storage space
- Consider using headphones for better audio
- Close unnecessary apps that might interfere

## Organizing your earnings call library

As you collect more recordings:

1. Use a consistent naming system (Company-Quarter-Year)
2. Tag recordings with relevant industries or themes
3. Store recordings in one secure place
4. Set times to review old calls for trend analysis

For instance, if you track tech companies, you might organize Apple, Microsoft, and Google recordings by quarter to compare trends over time.

1. Sign up for a recording service
