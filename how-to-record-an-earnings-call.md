# How to record an earnings call

Circleback offers straightforward methods for recording earnings calls, whether through its desktop app or by capturing public webcasts. After recording, the software automatically transcribes the call, identifies speakers, extracts key financial data, and organizes the information for easy reference and analysis.

## Methods for recording earnings calls

### Method 1: Using the desktop app

The desktop application records earnings calls without needing a bot to join the meeting.

1. Download and install the desktop app from circleback.ai/desktop (for macOS and Windows)
2. Log in to your account through the app
3. Select "New meeting → Record" from the top-right corner
4. Choose your recording preferences
5. Begin the earnings call on your preferred platform
6. Click the record button to start capturing
7. Select "Done" when the call ends

You can automate recordings for scheduled earnings calls:

1. Go to Settings → Calendar → Desktop recording
2. Enable automatic start/stop for recordings
3. Recordings will follow your calendar event times
4. A 30-second countdown appears before recording starts

### Method 2: Recording public earnings calls

For earnings calls hosted through public webcast services:

1. Register for the call through the company's investor relations page
2. Join the webcast or conference call at the designated time
3. Open the desktop app
4. Select "New meeting → Record" and begin recording
5. End the recording when the call concludes

## What happens after recording

After recording, the AI automatically:

1. Transcribes the entire call with high accuracy for financial terminology
2. Identifies different speakers (CEO, CFO, analysts, etc.)
3. Creates organized notes highlighting key financial figures and announcements
4. Extracts action items for follow-up
5. Provides insights specific to financial discussions

For example, after recording a company's earnings call, you might see an overview of quarterly revenue, key financial figures, strategic announcements, and action items.

## Advanced features for financial analysis

The search function lets you find specific moments from earnings calls instantly, such as projected expenditures, competitive mentions, or growth expectations.

The system supports transcription in over 100 languages for multinational companies that host calls in different languages.

After recording, you can share notes with your team, integrate with platforms like Slack or Notion, and create custom automations through Zapier or webhooks to update financial models.

## Privacy and security considerations

When recording earnings calls, the system ensures:
- Strong security for financial data
- No training of AI models on your sensitive information
- Compliance with data protection regulations

## Recording earnings calls on mobile devices

iOS 18.1+ users can record calls directly on their iPhone:

1. While on a call to an earnings webcast, select "record" in the top-left corner
2. Open the Notes app to find the recording
3. Select the recording, open the "..." menu, and select "Save Audio to Files"
4. Save the file to your device
5. Log in to Circleback in Safari
6. Select New → Import in the top right
